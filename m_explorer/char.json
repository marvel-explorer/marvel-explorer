        "powers": "The Ancient One's magic, like that of most true sorcerers, was derived from three major sources: personal powers of the soul, mind, and body, derived through developing one's own psychic resources (mesmerism, astral projection, thought-casting, etc.); powers gained by tapping this universe's ambient magical energy and employing it for specific effects (teleportation, illusion-casting, energy projection, etc.); and finally, powers gained through the tapping of extradimensional energy by invoking entities or objects of power existing in mystical dimensions tangential to his own. The latter means of power usually functions through the recitations of spells, either ritualized ones found in various mystical texts or by original spells invoking extradimensional assistance. The Ancient One also employed a number of occult power objects in performing certain magical feats.\nTo begin with his personal powers, the Ancient One mastered the art of astral projection, the mental ability to separate the astral self-the sheath of the soul, or life essence-from his physical self, and in this form traverse space unbounded by physical laws but fully retaining human consciousness. The astral form is invisible, intangible, and incapable of being harmed except by the most rigorous of mystical means. The astral form only possesses those magical powers residing in the sorcerer's mind (thought-casting, psycho kinesis, etc.) although it can also project bolts of mystical force that are effective only against other astral beings. In his prime the Ancient One possessed such mastery of astral form for up to 24 hours before his physical form would begin to undergo corporeal deterioration. The physical form was quite vulnerable to attack when the astral form was absent. While the Ancient One's astral form was absent, his physical form remained in a deathlike trance. If the Ancient One's physical form had been killed while he was in his astral form, he would have been stranded in his wraithlike state.\nThe Ancient One could mesmerize people to do his bidding, both in person and at a distance. The Ancient One could cast his thoughts over short or vast distances in a manner virtually identical with telepathy. The entire Earth was within the range of the Ancient One's mind, providing he knew where to contact the specific mind he was seeking. The Ancient One could simultaneously mentally communicate with up to a dozen minds at one time.\nThe Ancient One was also able to tap this universe's store of ambient magical energy mentally and to manipulate it mentally for a variety of effects. The Ancient One was able to form and hurl magical energy bolts with a high degree of potency and control. He was able to erect mystical energy shields or screens with a high degree of imperviousness to both physical and magical damage. He was able to use local magical energy for the conjuration of small physical objects or for unusual luminescent effects. The Ancient One could also transform one object into another, although the transformation only lasted for as long as he willed it.\nThe Ancient One was sometimes able to utilize magical energy to teleport himself across the face of the Earth or into a mystical dimension (certain higher dimensions where the physical laws can be based more on magic than on scientific principles in numerous cases). Oddly enough, teleportation within a dimension is more taxing than teleportation between dimensions. Such expenditure of energy leaves all human sorcerers mystically debilitated for varying lengths of time. Physical teleportation across time rather than space is the most power-draining means of teleportation. Hence, in his later years, the Ancient One refrained from performing self-teleportation.\nThe Ancient One possessed a knowledge of a host of sorcerous spells and incantations invoking the names and aspects of various extradimensional objects and beings of power. The Ancient One was able to call upon these extradimensional sources of mystical power for very specific effects without taxing his own personal abilities. Some of these extradimensional phenomena included the Flames of the Faltine, the Shades of the Seraphim, and the Hoary Hosts of Hoggoth.\nIn his extreme old age, the Ancient One was unable to perform major feats of sorcery without placing great physical strain upon himself.\n\nUpon his physical death, the Ancient One's spirit achieved mystical union with the universe. Hence, theoretically, the Ancient One may now be able to draw upon the vast mystical power of Eternity itself.",

Following his secondary mutation, Archangel can heal fatal injuries and cure most known diseases at an accelerated speed by mixing his blood with that of the victims, so long as they have a compatible blood type.\nAfter genetic alteration by Apocalypse, Archangel's wings became composed of a razor-sharp organic steel-like material, allowing him to use them as slashing weapons. He can also expel his feathers at great speed and with tremendous force, enabling them to pierce even steel. The feathers are tipped with a paralyzing chemical generated by his body (he is immune).

Briefly, Apocalypse has shown potential to be a powerful psionic.\n\nIt has further been hinted that Apocalypse's body is ravaged by a techno-organic disease. Many of his regenerated bodies must use an exoskeleton body armor to prevent his energies from consuming him. Apocalypse can apparently merge/switch host bodies to continually revive his self-consuming body.",

His wings are strong enough to carry aloft at least 200 pounds in addition to his own body weight. Archangel's entire anatomy is adapted for flight, having hollow bones; a body virtually devoid of fat, granting him enhanced proportionate muscle strength; eyes that can withstand high-speed winds; enhanced eyesight enabling him to see at distances far greater than the average human; and a special respiratory membrane that extracts oxygen from the air at extreme velocities and altitudes. Following his secondary mutation, Archangel can heal fatal injuries and cure most known diseases at an accelerated speed by mixing his blood with that of the victims, so long as they have a compatible blood type.\nAfter genetic alteration by Apocalypse, Archangel's wings became composed of a razor-sharp organic steel-like material, allowing him to use them as slashing weapons. He can also expel his feathers at great speed and with tremendous force, enabling them to pierce even steel. The feathers are tipped with a paralyzing chemical generated by his body (he is immune). He also briefly possessed the ability to convert his life-force into solid light to form a pair of energy wings.",

Through an act of concentration, she can channel a portion of the kinetic energy of the atomic motion in her body\u2019s molecules in a single direction, accelerating her body to a velocity in direct proportion to the amount of kinetic energy she has tapped. It is theoretically possible for Aurora to reach 99% of the speed of light (186,272 miles per second in a vacuum), but practical reasons - such as her inability to breathe at such speeds and the damage her body would suffer from wind and friction - prevent her from reaching anywhere near that speed. Even a fraction of such velocity of a solid object through Earth\u2019s atmosphere would wreak havoc on the atmosphere and on the land or sea below. As a side effect of partially robbing her molecules of their atomic motion, the binding forces within and between the molecules increase which enhances the sheer toughness of Aurora\u2019s entire body. This effect gives her skin enough durability to withstand speeds up to at least Mach 10 without injury. Formerly, by coming into physical contact with her brother, Aurora could vary the rate of acceleration of her molecules to release a cascade of photons as bright as a lighthouse beacon.\nFollowing alteration of her cellular structure by Sasquatch, Aurora\u2019s powers evolved from being able to generate light by herself to the point where she could transform into a being of pure light, the energy from which could bring inner peace to others. When these powers were exhausted, Aurora was still able to generate light and could alter its intensity from a hypnotic glow to dazzling brilliance or even concussive force.\n\nAfter genetic modification by the Weapon X Project, Aurora can now accelerate the molecules within an inanimate object or a living being by touch, causing it to tear itself apart from the subsequent stress generated upon it.",

However, if the vibrations were to be reflected back upon him, he would be injured.  Moreover, Avalanche's power has little or no effect on organic tissue.  Attempting to use his power on such tissue results in a feedback effect that can shatter the bones in Avalanche's arms.\n\nAs yet there is no known limit to the amount of area upon which Avalanche can use his powers at a given time.

He could overwhelm listeners with deafening noise, stun them with tight-focus low-frequency sonic blasts (effective even against shielded ears by penetrating the skull via bone conduction), plunge them into a hypnotic trance, disorient them, nauseate them, or simply render them unconscious. Using sonic waves, he could rapidly vibrate himself or other masses at will. He could generate sonic blasts which struck with tremendous concussive force, liquefying or outright disintegrating targets at his highest levels of power. By radiating sound waves outward and reading the feedback, he could locate and analyze unseen objects in a sonar-like fashion. By modulating his scream's harmonics, he could confuse most scanning equipment. He could instinctively analyze, replicate, and block sonic waves or vibrations from other sources. \nBanshee generated a psionic field which protected him from the detrimental effects of his sonic vibrations, though his sonic powers could still injure him when pushed beyond safe limits. His physiology seemed fully vulnerable to conventional injury when his sonic powers were not engaged. Banshee had selective hearing, enabling him to focus upon, enhance, or totally block out any given sound in his environment; this shielded him from the deafening sound of his own screams, and made him a superhumanly acute eavesdropper in surveillance situations. Sean and his cousin Black Tom were immune to each other's natural mutant energy powers, though Sean's immunity did not extend to the new powers Tom later developed via artificial mutations.",

He is adept in performing complicated sequences of gymnastics such as flips, rolls, and springs, and can also walk on his hands for many hours. Further, his manual and pedial dexterity are so great that he can perform multiple tasks such as writing with both hands at once or tie knots in rope with his toes.\n\nThe Beast possesses enhanced senses, the ability to secrete pheromones to attract members of the opposite sex, as well as a slight healing factor that allows him to regenerate minor wounds and recover quickly from minor ailments such as colds. The Beast also possesses cat-like night vision as well as razor-sharp claws on his hands and feet.",

Later seeking power to enable her to be a true partner to her lover, Spider-Man, she made a secret deal with the Kingpin, whose scientists imbued her with a genuine \"bad luck\" power. This power enabled her subliminally and psionically to affect probability fields, causing improbable, but not impossible, \"unlucky\" events to occur to enemies within her line of sight.\nAfter Dr. Strange removed the jinx Spider-Man contracted, the Cat's powers mutated, leaving her absent the bad luck ability, but with infrared vision, superhuman balance and agility, and long extensible claws.\n\nAfter exposure to the Chameleon's device from the Tinkerer, used to remove Spider-Man's powers, Felicia lost all her superhuman abilities as well. She has since relied upon the Tinkerer's high-tech inventions to support her feline antics. Black Cat's costume also contains micro-servos, which enhances her strength such that she is able to lift 800 lbs optimally. The Tinkerer has also provided her with metal mesh wired gloves with sensors to trigger extension of claws, agility-boosting implants and interaural balance compensators.",

He has demonstrated the ability to lacerate a person's throat with a thrown playing card, spit his own tooth through a human skull, toss a paper airplane to a distant rooftop, and kill a person with a toothpick thrown through a window from a hundred yards away.\nBullseye is in overall exceptional physical condition, with the agility, reflexes, stamina, and speed of a professional or Olympic athlete. A result of his naturally perfect athletic gift for hand-eye coordination is that his reflexes are actually honed to a level well beyond that of any normal human. He is physically strong enough to lift at least 350 pounds. Several of Bullseye's bones have been reinforced with strips of Adamantium, and his spine is now entirely made of it, effectively increasing his resistance to injury in unarmed combat. This reinforcement also allows Bullseye to consistently utilize a range of motion in his acrobatic maneuvers impossible for an ordinary human (as his bones are protected from fracture).\n\nAside from his ability to throw projectiles with lethal accuracy, Bullseye is also a master of many martial arts disciplines and is extremely talented in the use of edged weapons and conventional firearms. Often, his outspoken attitude during combat about using his abilities seems to have become one of his favorite weapons: intimidation. As such, he believes that his attention in the media grants him more effectiveness in combat with a near flawless reputation, rather than an assassin who often uses fear of the unknown.",

        "citizenship": "U.S.A.",
        "powers": "Cable possesses vast psychic power, most often manifested in the forms of telepathy and telekinesis.  His telepathy has proven great enough in power and scope as to allow him to read thoughts across vast distances, and even interface with multiple minds, simultaneously.  While the full limits of his mental abilities in this area have yet to be disclosed, Cable has also demonstrated the ability to project bolts or blasts of mental energy that are capable of easily killing or rendering unconscious another Human being.  These bolts do not do physical damage.  Cable has also demonstrated mastery of astral projection, and is able to remain on his own plane of existence, or to traverse into any of the so-called \"Astral Planes\", very much like Professor X.  \nTelekinetically, Cable is capable of very fine control over objects; he can disassemble complex devices explosively (separating every last component, such as screws, nuts, circuit boards, etc.), and just as quickly and easily assemble complex devices.  This also has enabled him to even attain awareness and control over objects as small as individual electrons in an atom.  For instance, Cable could detect if a seal was hermetic, or not, by checking for the presence of penetrating oxygen molecules.  He could even detect and discern individual oxygen molecules, and determine the atomic weight of molecules, by the amount of atoms present. Cable has also demonstrated the ability to alter molecular and atomic structures in such substances as his own techno-organic components (though this may be a function of telekinesis, as opposed to a discreet superhuman power).   \nOn larger levels, Cable can levitate great weights, into the tons, but his upper limit has remained undisclosed.  This is possible that he doesn\u2019t know his own limits, but it is unlikely, due to his intense commitment to training; more likely, Cable chooses not to disclose the full extent of his abilities, as he knows this is data that could be utilized against him, by opponents or even former allies.  Cable has also been seen creating protective force fields around himself and others through the use of his telekinetic powers.  The upper limits of this ability remain unknown, but it is believed that he could probably protect himself from harm at the ground zero detonation of a 1 kiloton nuclear warhead (4.18 terajoules of energy from the heat, concussion and radiation effects).  It is possible that this may not be his upper limit, and may also be an indicator of the limits of his ability to lift large weights telekinetically.  Cable has also displayed such control over the fields as to shape them precisely, even to conform very closely to his body\u2019s form.  There does not appear to be any correlation between field strength and the thickness of the telekinetic fields.  Originally, Cable was telekinetically preoccupied by using his power to inhibit the progression of his body\u2019s techno-organic virus throughout his body, and this was a process that required constant attention.  With the solution to this problem through his merger with a techno-organic embryo, however, this function is no longer necessary, leaving him totally free to concentrate his telekinetic powers on other things.  \nHe has displayed the ability to control the minds and even voluntary and involuntary bodily functions of sentient beings (such as other Humans) \nCable has proven very difficulty to psychically assail, as he is very well skilled in shielding his own mind from mental-attacks (such as attempts to read, control or harm his own mind), and has been sufficient to protect himself from other psychics on the level of Phoenix (Jean Grey), Professor X and Marvel Girl (Rachel Grey).\nMuch of Cable\u2019s body has been infiltrated and altered by the techno-organic virus, which has taken the form of cybernetics and bionics, meaning he is a cyborg.  The primary infection resides in Cable\u2019s left side.  As a consequence of his telekinetic guidance and his ability to control his own physical substance, Cable\u2019s entire body has been heavily fortified, down to the cellular level, rendering superhuman strength to an unknown degree, as well as a superhuman level of resistance to physical harm.  While he was injured in combat with the Hulk, the injuries were not nearly as severe as they should\u2019ve been, especially in light of the fact that he was suffering from the effects of his techno-organic virus getting out of control.  His entire skeletal structure has been replaced by porous, marrow-filled organic metalloid bone replacements that do not interfere with the creation of erythrocytes (red blood cells).  \nCable possesses superhuman physical endurance, just as he does superhuman levels of mental endurance.  He is capable of exerting himself at peak levels (fighting full-out, sprinting, etc.) for several hours, before fatigue begins to visibly impair his performance.  He is also capable of going extended periods of time without sleep, being fully capable of fully resting with not much over an hour of sleep.  However, whenever both possible and feasible, Cable still chooses to sleep for hours at a time (approximately 6 \u2013 8), in order to dream.  This high endurance has had other effects on his body, making even his soft tissues extremely durable, and more than up to the task of rendering him virtually immune to conventional firearms and conventional firearm munitions.  \nHis entire CNS (Central Nervous System) has been augmented by chemical changes down to the atomic level and by biocomputer enhancement, rendering his reaction time far above what is possible for a Human being.  In spite of his great size and impressive build, Cable is literally fast enough to evade high-powered bullets in-flight (after they have been fired), and even has the ability to visually track rounds after they\u2019ve been fired (though they are not easy to see, except through his cybernetic eye).  This great speed is also visible in superhuman levels of dexterity and agility, including manual and pedal dexterity.  Spotting the speedster Super-Saber running at superhuman speed, Cable was actually able to physically attack and stop him.  Super-Saber, himself, was fast enough to create \u201csonic booms\u201d by snapping his fingers, and also had superhumanly high reaction time.  However, in spite of his obviously great speed, he is still not as fast as other paranormals like Spider-Man and Daredevil.\nAmong his many cybernetic functions, Cable possesses a cybernetic left eye.  This eye permits Cable to see deep into the EM (Electro-Magnetic) spectrum, and far deeper than any known 20th \u2013 21st century technologies are capable of.  It is also possible that through this eye, Cable is able to see the deployment of psionic energies, as well as the less exotic spectra of electromagnetic energies.\nHis left arm is completely mechanical, and while Cable is ambidextrous, is his stronger arm, probably capable of allowing him to curl and deadlift several tons, without assistance from his right arm.  His right arm is also cybernetic, but far less so.\nThrough a combination of his telekinetic abilities, and his ability to rearrange the atomic structures of matter (including his own techno-organic matter), Cable is able to rapidly repair any damaged components within his body.  However, if there is widespread damage, this may not be possible, as he may be unable to muster the energy to affect these repairs.  When he was attacked by Magneto, and virtually every component in the left side of his body was damaged or destroyed, Cable was left unable to repair enough systems to save his own life, and required outside assistance.  It is through these abilities that the physical appearance of his cybernetic components has changed, over the passage of time, as well.  At times, they have been articulated, smooth artificial limbs, while at others they have been observed to grow razor-sharp blades on command, as well as retract them.  Cable is also able to rapidly redesign and improve his cybernetic and bionic components, thus.  On-the-spot improvisations has allowed him to create a variety of microcomputers in his totally mechanized left arm that do such things as allow him to physically interface with exterior computers, uplink/download to computers he has hidden across the world and in space (such as those he had on Graymalkin), and even permit cellular communications and high-speed, broadband, wireless Internet access.\n\nCable possesses an intellect that may be on par with that of Reed Richards, which may be superhuman.  He is also in possession of an education provided by the Clan Askani, which is far in advance of 20th \u2013 21st century Earth-616 conventional education, especially in the sciences.",

Its great overall resilience, combined with its natural concentric stiffness, enables it to rebound from objects with minimal loss of angular momentum.

Carnage possesses super-human strength, speed, stamina, healing and resistance to injury. He is orginally able to lift(press) 50 tons (currently 90 tons). \nCarnage can stick to walls, create \"swing lines\" or \"tendrils\" which he uses for traveling in a manner similar to how Spider-Man uses webbing, generate \"snares\" to trap or entangle foes. However, unlike Venom, he is able to create detachable weapons made entirely from his symbiotic. The symbiote can protect Kasady from bullets from small-arms weapons. The symbiote can mimic any type of clothing, but unlike Venom, it has not been seen capable of Venom's chameleon-like ability to act as camouflage. Carnage is able to deaden Spider-Man's spider-sense to a certain degree, and block the Venom symbiote's natural ability to track its own offspring.  \n\nIt is vulnerable to sonics (to a much lesser degree than Venom) and heat (to a much greater degree than Venom).",

Cerebro\u2019s computer systems can pinpoint a mutant\u2019s geographical location, roughly measure the mutant\u2019s power level, and even specify the mutant\u2019s identity if sufficient data exists within its systems. Cerebro has an extremely large 500 petabyte storage capacity. While its performance is significantly improved when operated by a trained psi-sensitive mutant, it is also user-friendly to non-mutants with proper training. Those unskilled in its use place themselves at risk of suffering serious mental trauma, even death, due to the strain the device can place on the mind. Extended use of Cerebro can result in a low-grade REM sleep disruption.",

Cyber was sufficiently strong enough to wreck a jeep using only one arm.\nCyber also possessed an accelerating healing factor similar to that possessed by Wolverine.  However, Cyber's healing factor wasn't nearly as efficient as Wolverine's.  For example, Cyber was unable to regenerate his left eye after it was gouged out by Wolverine in battle and was forced to use a cybernetic implant whereas Wolverine has regenerated missing eyes on numerous occassions  This healing factor would enable Cyber to repair damaged or destroyed tissue with much greater speed and efficiency than an ordinary human. It was due to Cyber's healing factor that he survived the process in which Adamantium was bonded to his skin. Aside from its great regenerative capabilities, Cyber was highly resistant, if not completely immune, against all known diseases.  Due to the presence of his healing factor, Cyber aged at a rate considerably slower than that of an ordinary human. Despite being, chronologically, well over 100 years old at the time of his death, Cyber retained the appearance and vigor of a man in the physical prime of his life.\nCyber's musculature generated considerably less lactic acids than the musculature of an ordinary human, due to his accelerated healing factor. As a result, Cyber possessed superhuman levels of stamina in all physical activities.    \nCyber's final superhuman ability was a low level psionic ability that enabled him to track individual brain patterns over an unspecified distance. After being exposed to vast quantities of the same toxins that tipped his claws, this ability was increased to an unknown limit. However, it was sufficient to track Wolverine across Edinburgh, Scotland and Muir Island.\n\nCyber was driven insane by exposure to a hallucinogenic drug, causing him to suffer mildly distracting delusionary side effects.",

Cyclops' body constantly absorbs ambient energy, such as sunlight, from his environment into his body's cells that allows him to open the apertures. Cyclops' mind generates a psionic field that is attuned to the forces that maintain the apertures. Because this field envelops his body, it automatically shunts the other-dimensional particles back into their point of origin when they collide with his body. Thus, his body is protected from the effects of the particles, and even the thin membranes of his eyelids are sufficient to block the emission of energy. The synthetic ruby quartz crystal used to fashion the lenses of Cyclops' eyewear is resonant to his minds' psionic field and is similarly protected.\nThe width of Cyclops' optic blast is focused by his mind's psionic field with the same autonomic function that regulated his original eyes' ability to focus. As Cyclops focuses, the size of the apertures change and thus act as a valve to control the flow of particles and the beam's relative power. The height of Cyclops's eye-blast is controlled by his visor's adjustable slit. The beam's effective range is approximately 2,000 feet.\n\nDue to a head injury, Cyclops is unable to shut off his optic blasts at will and must therefore wear ruby quartz lenses to block the beams.",

        "description": "Abandoned by his mother, Matt Murdock was raised by his father, boxer \"Battling Jack\" Murdock, in Hell's Kitchen. Realizing that rules were needed to prevent people from behaving badly, young Matt decided to study law; however, when he saved a man from an oncoming truck, it spilled a radioactive cargo that rendered Matt blind while enhancing his remaining senses. Under the harsh tutelage of blind martial arts master Stick, Matt mastered his heightened senses and became a formidable fighter.",

        "powers": "In compensation for his lost sight, Daredevil\u2019s other four senses have been preternaturally enhanced.\nHis sense of touch is sensitive enough to detect the faint impressions of ink on paper, allowing him to read by touch.  He is also able to feel minute changes in temperature and pressure, enough to sense a human body at a distance of five feet, due to body heat and air disturbance.  His sensitivity to heat allows him to sense the temperature of people and objects in order to determine whether a person is alive, how long they have been dead if they are not, and other changes in body temperature such as blushing or the heating up associated with various emotional states, as well as residual body heat on an object, or how recently a machine has been in use.\nDaredevil\u2019s sense of smell is enhanced enough to distinguish individuals by their natural odors, and remember and identify them no matter how they attempt to mask their scent, as well as track that individual scent through a crowd of people at a distance of roughly 50 feet.\nHis sense of taste is sharp enough to enable him to detect the number of grains of salt on a pretzel.  His ability to remember tastes enables him to determine every ingredient of a food or drink he tastes, as long as there are at least 20 milligrams of that substance present.\nDaredevil\u2019s enhanced sense of hearing enables him to detect an acoustic pressure change of 1 decibel at a pressure level of 7, whereas the average human can only detect a sound as low as 20 decibels.  He can even hear people speaking through a standard soundproofed wall.  Daredevil is also able to hear a heartbeat from 20 feet away, as well as identify people by their individual beat rhythm, or detect whether they are lying or not by the changes in their heartbeat, though a pace maker or self control will confuse his reading.  Not only does Daredevil\u2019s hearing allow him to be constantly aware of his own heartbeat, blood circulation, breathing, physical movements, etc, but he is also able to hear and sense the same attributes in other people.  One of the primary ways he does this is by hearing the reverberations made by ambient sounds on objects and people, giving him a sonar-like sense of where things are, and how dense they are.  And while he is able to block out a good amount of background noise, he can also be excessively disoriented by unexpected loud noises and can be confused when immersed in the wash of sound from a busy crowd.\nAlong with the enhancement of Daredevil\u2019s normal senses, he has gained another sense which he calls his Radar Sense.  According to one theory, this sense reacts to an emission of electromagnetic energy a mutation in his brain has caused, reading the reverberations of this energy as a 360\u00ba, 3-D map of objects.  This \u201csight\u201d is not perfect, and can only give Daredevil an impression of the exact physical shape of objects, not a literal one.  Closely overlapping objects can also confuse this sense.\n\nThe mutations that have heightened Daredevil\u2019s level of sensitivity have also increased his awareness of other forms of electromagnetic radiation.  He is capable of detecting and identifying any electromagnetic radiation on the standard scale; from radio waves, (which he can only detect, not understand the message) all the way to gamma waves, and everything in between.  He is also able to judge the strength of a given radiation and even differentiate between individual colors by the amount of radiation they give off.  At very close range, Daredevil is able to detect the micro voltage of a human being\u2019s brain.",

        "weapons": "Tentacles: Doctor Octopus' superhuman abilities derive from the four mentally-controlled, electronically-powered, telescoping, prehensile titanium-steel tentacles attached to a stainless steel harness encircling his body from lower chest to waist. Each tentacle, approximately five inches in diameter, terminates in three single-jointed pincers. The pincers are able to rotate in relation to the arm for 360 degrees, in a screwdriver-like twisting motion. Each tentacle segment contains four high-efficiency electric motors equipped with a clutched, helical-gear train, independently mounted on frictionless gimbals and housed in four thin, overlapping layers of titanium-niobium steel. The titanium-steel alloy is light, has high-tensile strength, a high melting point, and high thin-wall rigidity. The motors get their power from a small nuclear-powered thermo-electric generator, which can provide several hundred watts per hour for up to five years before needing to replace its U-239 core. The tentacles have been modified since the time of the original accident to include high-efficiency battery packs (enabling movement when cut off from the central power source) and individual micro-circuit control modules (enabling each arm to perform certain pre-programmed actions when Octopus loses conscious control). In the event that Octopus loses consciousness, the control module of each arm has enough pre-programmed conditional responses in its memory chip to enable it to perform a relatively complex sequence of actions, such as saving his life. The trauma of his arm or arms being separated from the harness causes a period of disorientation in which his arms flail about uncontrollably until the pre-programming takes over. \nTelescoping: Each tentacle is approximately six feet long at full contraction, but can extend to a maximum of 24 feet in length.  \nSuperhuman Striking Force: Each tentacle is capable of moving at a speed of ninety feet per second and strike with the force of a jackhammer. \nHigh-Wind Generation: The tentacles can generate 50 mile per hour winds if spun like a giant fan. \nWall-Climbing and Traveling: By combining the intrinsic strength of both his tentacles and the pincers, Doctor Octopus can scale stone, brick, or concrete walls by rending \"handholds\" in the surface of the wall. Octopus is able to use his tentacles for traversing horizontal distances as well. At full extension, he can travel high above the ground as if on stilts, either using two tentacles, or for maximum speed (approximately 50 miles per hour), four tentacles. \nSensation Feeling: Although there are no nerve endings throughout the length of his artificial arms, Octopus can \"feel\" basic sensations with them. As a result of the mutagenic changes from exposure to radiation during the accident, electrical connections have been made from his chest harness to his spine. Thus, Doctor Octopus can mentally perceive \"tactile\" sensations by feeling the amount of electrical resistance that the pincer's electric motors feel when the pincers grasp an object.",

This effect constantly emanates from her body at all times and is completely subconscious. However, it is also largely participatory - in order for the luck to take effect, Domino herself must engage in an action whose chance she can affect. \nFor example, if debris falling from the sky was about to hit her in the head, she would still be hurt if she stood still. However, if she tried to avoid them, she would move perfectly to avoid each and every piece about to hit her. In addition if Domino were to stand before a hail of bullets she would be a bullet-ridden corpse. Instead, she must take action, attempting to avoid the gunfire and will miraculously bob and weave just perfectly to avoid every single shot. As a byproduct of her probability abilities, Domino's cerebral cortex emits a current of bio-electric pulses down her spine to instinctively guide her movements during such situations, which has the added effect of augmenting her natural reflexes and agility to near-superhuman levels. \n\nAlthough Domino cannot consciously control her ability, she can activate it by putting herself in a position in which she could be harmed.

He can levitate; restructure molecules; convert matter into energy and vice-versa; project energy with enormous concussive force; teleport himself, others, and objects across space, dimensions, and time; erect virtually impenetrable fields; restore others from any injury, even total disintegration; and endow or enhance powers within others. Even his heralds, imbued with the smallest fraction of his power, can manipulate matter and energy far beyond human comprehension. Though he generally avoids physical conflict, Galactus can bolster his own strength beyond any known system of measure. Galactus is telepathic, able to scan the thoughts of virtually any known being. \nTo sustain his immense power, Galactus requires energies derived from a biosphere, a planet able to sustain living beings, though life does not actually have to be present. Though Galactus can extract and absorb this energy himself, he generally employs his immense Elemental Converter to perform the process, as it is far more efficient and avoids the expenditure required of him. Sometimes the planets on which he feeds are left barely habitable; other times he consumes all life and water, leaving it devastated and barren; most often the process reduces the planet to space rubble. When Galactus was newly formed, the energy of a medium-size Earth-like planet sustained him for over a century. Now he needs to feed about once a month; in addition, when preparing for a massive expenditure of energy, he may absorb planets more frequently to amplify his power stores. Conversely, when he does not feed within his allotted time, his energies will dwindle, and he will even begin to physically shrink as they drop dangerously low. His body totally converts the energies he absorbs for his life functions and activities without any waste products.\n\nThough seemingly destroyed on several occasions, Galactus is always restored to full power eventually. In addition, despite being a physical being, Galactus can adopt a manifestation (M-Body) from the Dimension of Manifestations in order to commune with abstract beings, such as Death and Eternity.",

He can survive unprotected in the vacuum of outer space, being able to go long periods of time without needing to draw breath.  Thanks to his incredible lung capacity, Gladiator is also able to draw in large amounts of air and then expel it all to create a gale force wind.  Gladiator can also project intense beams of heat from his eyes that can reach temperatures comparable to those produced by stars, as well as microscopic vision that lets him see beyond the sub-atomic barrier.\n\nMuch, if not all of Gladiator's abilities are entirely dependent on his level of self-confidence.  The more confident he is in being able to complete the task at hand, the more powerful he becomes.  Consequently, if Gladiator ever has the slightest hint of doubt that he is unable to accomplish something, then his powers quickly weaken.",

These waves will emanate from his body in all directions unless he purposefully tries to channel them in a single direction, usually along the length of his arms. Havok is himself immune to the intense heat he creates, as well as the power blasts generated by his brother Cyclops.\nDespite past accounts, the energy that Havok releases is not truly a concussive force.  When Havok strikes an object with the waves of intensity of hot plasma, the sudden vast jump in temperature will often cause objects to shatter, explode, or seemingly disintegrate, and an observer might therefore wrongly think that the object had been struck by a concussive force.  Should Havok direct his energy at the lowest level, he can project it towards a human being and his target will suffer a severe headache but will not burn up.\n\nHavok's body is constantly in the process of absorbing cosmic radiation. When each of his body's power-storage cell enclaves reaches its capacity, excess cosmic energy is thereafter absorbed and immediately re-emitted in negligible quantities. Upon the total expenditure of all his available energy, it takes Havok's body about 16 hours to recharge to its peak level. The act of concentration involved in releasing his energy in anything other than an omnidirectional wave is physically exhausting for Havok if he continues it over an extended period of time.",

Hercules can make a standing high jump of at least 100 feet in Earth's gravity.\nHercules is also an Olympian thereby being an immortal, and as true immortals, the Olympian gods do not age and are not susceptible to disease. Although they can be wounded in battle, they cannot die by any conventional means, and have a rapid healing rate. Hercules has a greater resistance to physical injury than any other Olympian god except for Zeus, and possibly Neptune and Pluto. Hercules is virtually tireless. His supernaturally enhanced musculature produces no fatigue poisons. He can even survive unprotected in the vacuum of space for a brief period of time. Only an injury of such magnititude that it incinerated him or dispersed a major portion of his bodily molecules could kill Hercules. In at least some such cases, Zeus or one of the other gods might still be able to resurrect him.",

The club was supplanted by his current weapon, his Golden Mace, which is not actually made of gold but was forged by the god Hephaestus from enchanted adamantine, the legendary substance after which Dr. Myron MacLain named his artificially created adamantlure.

Bench mentally controls every drop of his bodily liquid; his watery form will gradually reintegrate if it has been vaporized or otherwise dispersed. He can merge with or absorb ordinary, existing water in his environment, often using it to increase his mass and volume. Bench's strength is slightly enhanced by his abnormal physiology. Recent alterations of his powers by the Wizard have enabled Bench to mentally manipulate water sources outside his own body, and have given him a finer degree of control over his own fluid form. However, the Wizard also intentionally weakened Bench's molecular cohesion, and developed a device enabling him to reduce Bench to an inert mass of liquid if necessary, ensuring Hydro-Man's loyalty.",

He has even once shown the ability to achieve absolute zero temperatures, with the help of the Human Torch (who pulled the ambient heat away from Iceman), and was able to stop the molecular motion of a bomb. Iceman can augment his ice form with extraneous moisture to enhance his strength and durability, and can reshape his body's ice form at will by using any available moisture from his surrounding environment. Similarly, Iceman can rebuild his ice form if any part of it is broken or if it is shattered completely without suffering any permanent damage.\nPreviously, Iceman was able to transform his body into solid ice and back to human form at will.  For a time, however, his body was permanently transformed into solid ice as a result of a secondary mutation. After M-day, Iceman appeared to have lost his powers, returning to human form. However, this was revealed by Emma Frost as a mental block, and Iceman later regained his powers, along with the ability to change from human to ice form.\n\nIceman also possesses the potential to transport himself quickly over great distances through nearby flows of water by merging his body\u2019s molecules with those of the stream.",

She achieves these feats by mentally bending all wavelengths of light in the vicinity around herself or the target in question, and she somehow does this without causing any visible distortion effects; she also somehow directs enough undistorted light to her eyes to retain her full range of vision while invisible. Sue can also mentally generate a psionic field of invisible force apparently drawn from hyperspace, which she manipulates for a variety of effects. Most commonly, Sue generates near-indestructible invisible force fields around herself or other targets. She can vary the texture and tensile strength of her field to some extent, rendering it highly rigid or as soft and yielding as foam; softer variations on the field enable her to cushion impacts more gently, and are less likely to result in a psionic backlash against Sue herself (in rare cases, sufficiently powerful attacks on her psionic fields can cause her mental or physical pain). \nSue can shape her psionic force fields into invisible constructs, usually simple shapes such as barriers, columns, cones, cylinders, darts, discs, domes, platforms, rams, ramps, slides and spheres. By generating additional force behind her psionic constructs, Sue can turn them into offensive weapons, ranging from massive invisible battering rams to small projectiles such as spheres and darts. She can generate solid force constructs as small as a marble or as large as 100 feet in diameter, and her hollow projections such as domes can extend up to several miles in area. By forming one of her force fields within an object and expanding the field, Sue can cause her target to explode. She can also travel atop animated constructs such as ramps, stairs, slides, columns and stepping discs, enabling her to simulate a limited approximation of levitation or flight. She is capable of generating and manipulating multiple psionic force fields simultaneously. Sue once swapped powers with her brother Johnny for a brief period, and during that time had the ability to generate and manipulate flames for various effects.",

The duplicates think, feel, and act independently, though usually guided by the original. Each tends to manifest one aspect of Madrox's personality, which increases in strength with lengthier separation from the original; these traits have recently become more extreme. Madrox is telepathically and empathically linked to his duplicates, suffering severe, potentially fatal, trauma if one dies. Madrox can \"reabsorb\" his duplicates, gaining their new knowledge and skills. Similarly, he will acquire any physical injury - though not any actual toxin - from a duplicate; symptoms are typically lessened by half during absorption. If Madrox himself were killed, it is not known whether any existing duplicates would continue to function independently; it is virtually impossible to distinguish the original from the duplicates.",

However, Magneto almost always uses only magnetism, since it\u2019s more difficult for him to manipulate other forms of energy. Magneto has also exhibited powers of astral projection and telepathy, and has claimed to be able to control the minds of others, though his abilities along these lines appear to be minimal.\n\nMagneto\u2019s ability to wield his superhuman powers effectively is dependent upon his physical condition.

Even after losing much of his physical mass, his body will rebuild itself, drawing new material as needed from the surrounding swamp. Similarly, he can ooze through or around openings or barriers, such as wire mesh or steel bars.\nThe Man-Thing is extremely sensitive to emotion, which can affect his behavior and physiology. Mild emotions arouse \"curiosity,\" and lead the Man-Thing to observe events from a distance. Violent emotions, such as fear, anger, and hatred, cause him extreme discomfort, often provoking him to attack. Fear in particular causes him to secrete a chemical similar to fuming sulfuric acid, such that whatever knows fear burns at the touch of the Man-Thing. \n\nThe Man-Thing's unique mystical-chemical physiology makes him dependent on swamp environments, particularly the Florida Everglades near Citrusville. While he is ageless and immune to disease, prolonged separation from the swamp could render him dormant or dead. Exposure to the chemicals of a sewage treatment plant has slowed the rate at which he weakens, and he recovers rapidly when returned to the swamp.",

Without artificial aids, Mastermind cannot cause only one person among many who are present to see his illusions; everyone within the range of his power, which can extend over an entire city (as when he helped Magneto capture Latin American nation of Santo Marco), will see his illusions. Since his power only affects the mind, his illusions cannot be recorded on film or tape or by other means. However, his power works so strongly on the mind that even if his victim or victims know they are being subjected to an illusion, they will still react to the illusion as if it were real unless they can rid themselves of all suspicions that it is unreal. Hence, if Mastermind creates the illusion of a wall, most people, even if they know it is an illusion, will still be unable to walk through it.

Mephisto can capture the souls of recently deceased humans, though this usually applies only to beings who bargain away their souls to him. Mephisto can mystically trap living beings in his realm, but he cannot feed off these beings and rarely chooses to do this. A portion of his power seems to be tied to his realm and the number of souls trapped within it, meaning that prolonged absences from Hades weaken him. Mephisto does not need to eat, sleep or breathe, and is immune to aging and conventional disease.",

He also possesses superhuman agility, reflexes, and speed, with a maximum swimming speed of roughly sixty miles per hour. Namor is able to fly via the finlike wings on his ankles, and he possesses a telepathic rapport with many, but not all, forms of marine life. Like all Atlanteans, he has a prolonged lifespan and his body is specially developed for underwater conditions, granting him specialized blood circulation to withstand freezing temperatures and highly developed vision to see clearly even in murky ocean depths. This hybrid physiology means he can survive indefinitely underwater or on land (though he would still need occasional contact with water to survive). Namor possesses an empathic bond with his cousin Namorita.\nIn the past, Namor has demonstrated additional powers similar to the attributes of various forms of sea life, including the electricity-generating capabilities of an electric eel and the radar sense of cavefish; however, he has demonstrated such abilities only sporadically, suggesting that they depend upon some factor of his Atlantean mutant nature that is not yet understood.\n\nWhen not exposed to water, Namor\u2019s physical attributes gradually decline and can diminish over time to near-human levels, robbing him of his strength and rendering him vulnerable to conventional injuries; renewed exposure to water will immediately restore his abilities. Complete lack of contact with water will prove fatal in about a week\u2019s time. Namor has demonstrated a vulnerability to oxygen imbalance when remaining too long in either water or air, resulting in manic-depressive mood swings; he can prevent this imbalance by dividing his time between the two atmospheres. He has occasionally used scientific or magical means to regulate his oxygen levels.",

MacLain was never able to duplicate the process due to his inability to identify a still unknown factor that played a role in it. The shield was awarded to Captain America by the government several months after the beginning of his career.\nThe shield has great aerodynamic properties: it is able to slice through the air with minimal wind resistance and deflection of path. Its great overall resilience, combined with its natural concentric stiffness, enables it to rebound from objects with minimal loss of angular momentum. It is virtually indestructible: it is resistant to penetration, temperature extremes, and the entire electromagnetic spectrum of radiation. The only way it can be damaged in any way is by tampering with its molecular bonding.",

This effect gives his skin enough durability to withstand speeds up to at least Mach 10 without injury.

Odin, despite his advanced age at the time of his death, was much stronger than the average Asgardian male, which could lift roughly 30 tons.  \nLike all other Asgardians, Odin was extremely long lived and aged at a much slower pace than humans, but was not immortal in the same sense as some other races of gods who ceased to age upon reaching adulthood. Odin was highly resistant to physical injury and he couldn't die under conventional circumstances. It would take an injury that resulted in a spreading of a significant portion of his bodily molecules over a great distance, thus preventing the mystical lifeforce common to all Asgardians from regenerating areas essential to his survival, to cause him to physically die. The tissues of Odin's body; his flesh, bone, and muscle possessed about three times the density of the tissue of a human body.  This helped to contribute to Odin's superhuman strength and weight. Odin's advanced musculature generated considerably less lactic acids than the musculature of human beings, granting him superhuman levels of stamina in all physical activities.\n\nOdin possessed vast energy manipulating abilities called the Odinforce and could manipulate tremendous amounts of mystical energies for a variety of purposes, only some of which were seen. Odin could temporarily increase his own superhuman physical attributes, fire powerful bursts of energy for destructive purposes, teleportation between dimensions, grant living beings or inanimate objects a variety of superhuman abilities, control the lifeforce of other Asgardians, etc. He was periodically required to enter week-long Odinsleep to preserve his immortality and renew his godly energies.",

Within his kinetic field it is nearly impossible for him to be hurt, and he instead bounces harmlessly from object to object, with no loss or transference of momentum.   \nWhen transformed into Speedball, he was covered with a blue-and-gold costume (originally a facsimile of the lab uniform he wore when exposed to the energy) and surrounded by a display of multi-colored bubbles. At first, Robbie would transform uncontrollably if hit with a slight force, but was later able to activate the effect consciously. He typically used the field to slam into his opponents, and the multi-colored light display can be used to distract opponents. After many years, Robbie learned to extend the kinetic field outward, pushing back everything in his immediate area or, by focusing more locally, delivering more powerful blows in hand-to-hand combat.\n\nAfter the assassination attempt by Mr. Stricker, Robbie's powers changed and are now fueled by pain. His armor channels the power into energy conduits via the interoir lining's spikes. The extents and details of Robbie's new powers as Penance have yet to be revealed.",

Kitty can phase her clothing along with herself, and through practice has learned to phase other objects and people without harm to them. For all intents and purposes, Kitty is intangible whilst phasing, however she is still vulnerable to psionic or mystical attacks. Certain forms of energy can also disrupt her phased state.\nWhen Kitty phases through an object with an electrical system, the process disrupts the system's workings. This includes the electrical impulses found in the human brain. Kitty can phase part or all of her body through another living being without harm to herself, though the other being can be rendered unconscious as a result. Kitty also has the potential to kill another being by phasing them into a solid object and then releasing them, causing them to solidify whilst still within the object.\nKitty passes through objects at the same rate of speed at which she is moving before phasing. Since she is unable to breathe while phasing, she can only continuously phase through solid objects - as when she travels underground - as long as she can hold her breath. Kitty can keep her phased form at rest in relation to the rotation of the Earth upon its axis, thus allowing her to assume a ground speed of the length of a football field and a half every second. Kitty can also walk on air whilst phasing.\n\nKitty has trained herself to reflexively assume a phased state at any indication of danger, such as a loud noise like a gunshot, in order to protect herself.",

When the High Evolutionary's Isotope E upgraded his powers, he did not know the true limits of his speed.\nFollowing the loss of his mutant nature, Quicksilver exposed himself to the Terrigen Mists, resulting in him now possessing the power to vibrate his atoms so quickly he travels forward in time. His molecular speed that he generates displaces him out of the mainstream time/space so that he is able to propel himself into the future. He can leap from thirty seconds to up to twelve days, and remain for several minutes to several hours before being recalled to his present time once his body tires, or he can return at will before his time is up. As he returns from his trip, he returns the exact moment he left so as to appear that he has been gone for half a nano-second. He is able to bring inorganic objects from the future back to his correct time, although it has yet been shown what would happen if he attempted to bring organic objects with him. These new powers are having an affect on his physical health. Each time he meets up with his future self (if indeed the person he meets is his future self), the future self looks more and more haggard. \n\nAfter the incident on Genosha, Pietro continued to inhale the Mists of Terrigen and has apparently obtained the power, with the shards of the Mists in his hands, to restore other mutants\u2019 powers.",

        "powers": "Franklin Richards is a mutant with vast psionic powers. His abilities are so great that he can create \"pocket\" universes in alternate realities. (A \"pocket\" universe is a cosmos that does not equal our own in size.) When Franklin achieves the conscious use of his full powers, he will have telepathic powers, tremendous telekinetic powers, the ability to fire enormously powerful energy blasts, and the ability to rearrange the molecular structure of matter, even up to a cosmic scale.\nFranklin Richards has imposed mental blocks within his own mind to prevent him from using most of his psionic potential while he is still such a young child. It is possible that the strength of these blocks has faded over time, or that they cannot prevent him from utilizing his full powers unconsciously, as he did in creating the alternate reality to which he dispatched his parents and others following their clash with Onslaught. The mental blocks also work only when Franklin is in his physical body; his astral form can apparently use all of his psionic potential if it has separated from his physical form.\nThe mental blocks did not restrict Franklin from using his precognitive abilities, which manifest themselves in his dreams, enabling him to envision possible future events. Although there are countless possible futures, Franklin foresees the most probable future path, and therefore his predictions usually come true. Franklin seemingly cannot foresee events more than roughly a few days in the future. Franklin's precognitive power developed to the point at which he could see images of future events even when he's conscious.\nFranklin also developed the ability to place himself in a trance-like state while remaining fully conscious. While he is in this trance, he can project an intangible, ghostlike image of himself to another location, through which he can see and hear what goes on at that location. What Franklin has called the \"dreams\" he has while in this state are not truly dreams, but his conscious awareness of the environment into which he has projected his \"dream-self.\" It is not yet known how far Franklin can project his \"dream-self\" away from his physical body, but he has projected it onto a planet while his physical body was in a starship high above the planet's surface.\n\nFranklin has not recently manifested his powers to perceive the future or to project a \"dream-self\" and it is not clear whether he can still use these abilities or whether they have returned to latency.",

Such transfers lasted for 60 times longer than the contact time, with extended contact resulting in the possibility of permanent absorption. No upper limit had been determined for the number of beings Rogue could simultaneously imprint.\nUpon absorbing another's memories, Rogue also gained any associated emotional responses. Rogue was typically able to control such emotions, however absorbing psyches more powerful than her own resulted in Rogue\u2019s psyche being supplanted.\nAfter permanently absorbing the powers of Ms. Marvel, Rogue possessed an amalgamated mutant human/alien Kree physiology that granted her a degree of immunity to poisons, and a virtually indestructible body. Rogue also possessed Ms. Marvel's above normal reflexes and psychic \"seventh sense\" that enabled her to subconsciously anticipate an opponent\u2019s moves. Whilst Rogue possessed Ms. Marvel's psyche, her \"double\" consciousness made her resistant to telepathic probes from even the most powerful mind readers. She also gained Ms. Marvel's incredible strength, and supersonic flight.\nAfter absorbing the powers of an alien Skrull, Rogue began to spontaneously reactivate previously absorbed abilities. Rogue could also tap into the residual psychic energy of those she had imprinted to determine their status and to relive past events from their perspective.\n\nRecently, Rogue has seemingly permanently absorbed the fire-based powers of Sunfire.",

Sabretooth's primary mutant power is an accelerated healing factor that enables him to regenerate damaged or destroyed tissue with far greater speed and efficiency than an ordinary human.  Sabretooth can fully heal from injuries that result in massive tissue and blood loss such as multiple gunshots, slashes, puncture wounds, and severe burns within only a few minutes. This mutant healing factor also renders Sabretooth highly resistant, possibly even totally immune, to disease.  Sabretooth's healing powers, also, render him immune to most drugs and toxins, except within massive doses. sabretooth can lift [press] 118 tons. Sabretooth ages much slower than an ordinary human. Despite having a much greater chronological age, Sabretooth possesses the appearance and vitality of a man in the physical prime of his life. All of Sabretooth's natural mutant abilities stem from, at least partially, his accelerated healing factor.when sabretooth goes feral his brute strength increases without limit.\nSabretooth possesses superhumanly acute senses of sight, hearing, smell, and taste - although perhaps not of touch - comparable to those of certain animals, allowing him to track prey similar to the way dogs and wolves do. His night vision is preternaturally sensitive, containing twice the average human being\u2019s area of light-gathering retina, and extends into the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. His hearing is extraordinarily acute, able to detect light breathing in a cave at 200 feet. His sense of taste can detect 1 part of foreign matter in 10,000. His highly developed olfactory sense and memory allow him to detect and track a scent over eight hours old, possibly a concentration of 20 parts per million, that he had not been exposed to for up to several months previously. Dilute, common odors of perspiration, perfumes, cigarettes, candies, and food are beacons to his senses.\nMany of Sabretooth's physical abilities function with superhuman levels of efficiency.  He possesses some degree of superhuman strength, the limits of which are unknown. Originally, Sabretooth possessed sufficient physical strength to crush an iron barbell, with ease. Sabretooth has undergone various procedures, some willingly and some unwillingly, that have increased his strength considerably beyond his original levels. Sabretooth's mutant healing factor grants him much greater immunity to the lactic acids generated by his muscles during physical activity than the musculature of an ordinary human. Hence, Sabretooth possesses superhuman stamina in all physical activities.  His natural agility and reflexes are enhanced to levels that are beyond the natural limits of the human body. Sabretooth's agility and reaction time are superior to those of the finest human athlete.\n\nCurrently, Sabretooth's entire skeleton has been artificially infused with the, virtually indestructible, alloy known as Adamantium.  As a result, Sabretooth's bones are unbreakable.",

His brain has attained subliminal awareness of all granulated particles of his body. Through conscious effort, he can affect the degree of molecular cohesion between the numerous adjoining surfaces of his particles and thus cause locomotion of discrete volumes, down to the individual grains. His radically mutagenically altered body composition and increased density enable him to compact or loosen the particles of sand that make up his form. Consequently, the Sandman can become as hard as sandstone, or disperse his body so that he becomes invulnerable to physical attacks. He can shape his sand-state body into any continuous shape he can imagine. He can project his sand particles outward at high speeds and, when in the shape of a bulky object, with the impact of a large sandbag.\nThe Sandman is vulnerable to temperatures over 3,400 degrees Fahrenheit. Such temperatures can cause his highly impure silicate composition to fuse into amorphous silicate (glass). The Sandman maintains mental control of the particles of which his body is composed so that he can reform his scattered grains unless a substantial portion of his body mass has been isolated. Apparently, he can also convert common grains of sand around him into constituents of his body to replenish portions he might lose track of during battle. In this manner, he can increase his overall size and volume (to some as yet unknown limit), or that of his limbs.\nThere appears to be no limit to how long the Sandman can remain in his sand-state. If he were to be rendered unconscious while in his sand-state, he would remain in that state, although the relaxing of his control over his particles would cause him to become an amorphous pile of sand.\n\nThe Sandman's mind continues to function in astral form even when he has turned his head into sand and even when the particles of sand that composed his brain are widely scattered. The limit to how far the particles of his brain can be dispersed before he is unable to reassemble is not yet known.",

Since taking over Snowbird's original body, he can now achieve his Sasquatch form with relative little pain or effort.",

With the people dubbing The Sentry as the world's most powerful superhero, and with the serum causing a photosynthetic reaction to his body, completely altering his state of consciousness, it is nonetheless conceivable that Sentry's powers are limitless, and may even rival those of the Silver Surfer's and Phoenix's.

The costume was made of a material that could serve as a bulletproof jacket against small caliber bullets. For the first upgrade to the costume, Stark added three mechanical waldo arms, which can grab and move objects as well housing cameras which transmit images back to the costume's eyepiece. The waldoes can also be used offensively in combat.

She can stimulate the creation of any form of precipitation such as rain or fog, generate winds in varying degrees of intensity up to and including hurricane force, raise or lower the humidity and temperature in her immediate vicinity, induce lightning and other electrical atmospheric phenomena, and disperse natural storms so as to create clear change. Storm can direct the path of certain atmospheric effects, such as bolts of lightning, with her hands. She has also demonstrated the ability to manipulate ocean currents, though the extent of this ability is still unclear.\nStorm\u2019s control over the atmosphere is such that she can create certain effects over a specific area while shielding smaller areas within that region. For example, she can create a rainstorm around herself but prevent the raindrops from touching her. Storm can also create atmospheric phenomena over very small areas, such as creating a rainstorm small enough to water a single potted plant.\nStorm can only manipulate weather patterns as they exist in nature. For example, she can end a drought in one area by creating torrential rains there, but that would necessitate robbing all available moisture from the surrounding areas. Storm is not able to create atmospheric conditions that do not exist naturally on the planet she is on. For example, Storm is unable to lower temperatures as far as absolute zero or raise them to solar intensities on Earth.\nThe limit to the size of the area over which Storm can manipulate the weather is not yet known. However, she once diverted the jet stream so as to create storms over the entire East Coast of the United States. She can create weather effects within indoor areas or within artificially maintained environments. Storm is limited by the force of her will and the strength of her body. It once took her several hours to stop a savage blizzard sweeping over much of Canada, and she nearly died from exhaustion in the process.\nStorm is able to fly by creating winds strong enough to support her weight, the weight of others, and to propel her forward through the air. Storm can thus travel as fast as any wind can, and has reached speeds up to 300 miles per hour. Her powers over the atmosphere enable her to breathe at any speed, protect her from air friction, and grant her limited immunity to extreme heat and cold.\nStorm is also able to alter her visual perception so as to perceive electrical energy patterns as well as those factors responsible for existing meteorological phenomena in her surrounding environment.\n\nStorm's ability to manipulate the weather in her immediate vicinity is affected by her emotions; hence, if she does not maintain control, a fit of rage might induce a destructive storm. Storm also suffers from severe claustrophobia.",

Sunfire also generates an invisible field of psionic energy which protects him from the heat and radiation generated by his own powers, as well as from outside sources. The field also shields him from air friction and the light generated by his plasma, as well as lending a certain level of protection from kinetic impact.",

He can also channel his godly energies through Mjolnir into blasts so powerful that they can slay even immortals. Mjolnir can absorb other energies into itself, which Thor can then release.\nMjolnir obeys Thor\u2019s commands as though it were alive, and if Thor\u2019s will is strong enough, the hammer can pass through nearly any barrier to reach him should he so desire. Using this command over Mjolnir\u2019s flight path, Thor is able to use the hammer to fly, achieving escape velocities. Mjolnir can also transform Thor into his civilian guises. When Thor is a civilian, the hammer most often becomes an old wooden cane. While employing a mortal guise, Thor will transform back into his mortal form should he be separated from Mjolnir for more than 60 seconds. \n\nBy spinning Mjolnir in a circle, Thor can open portals to other dimensions. Formerly, it also allowed him to travel in time, but Immortus removed this power. Enchantments surrounding Mjolnir prevent it from being wielded by anyone except those who have been found worthy. Thus far, this includes Thor, Odin, Tiwaz, Red Norvell, Beta Ray Bill, Captain America and Eric Masterson. To anyone else, Mjolnir cannot be lifted from the ground nor wrested from Thor\u2019s grip.",

The latter ray also allows Ultron to mesmerize and outright mind-control his victims, or implant subliminal hypnotic commands within their minds to be enacted at a later time. Ultron's outer shell is usually composed of Adamantium, rendering it almost totally impervious to damage; however, his internal mechanisms are generally less durable and more easily damaged. Ultron's Adamantium forms have proven vulnerable to molecular rearrangement devices and the metal-destabilizing ore known as Savage Land Vibranium (\"anti-metal\"). Some Ultron models feature tractor beams and energy absorption capabilities. Most Ultrons are powered by a small internal nuclear furnace, and incorporate a \"program transmitter\" which can beam part or all of Ultron's programming into remote locations such as computers or alternate robotic bodies. Ultron can often control other machines remotely even if he has not transplanted his consciousness into them. One recent Ultron model developed hive-mind technology, allowing him to animate and control hundreds of alternate Ultron bodies at the same time, becoming a robotic one-man army. Ultron is one of the foremost robotics experts on Earth.",

He also used anti-gravity bolas, heavy gravity bolas, and various other devices also of his own design.

        "powers": "Wolverine is a mutant who possesses the ability to regenerate damaged or destroyed areas of his cellular structure at a rate far greater than that of an ordinary human. The speed at which this healing factor works varies in direct proportion with the severity of the damage Wolverine suffers. For example, he can fully recover from an ordinary gunshot wound in a non-vital area of his body within minutes, but it took him almost two months to fully recover from injuries sustained in a duel with Lord Shingen, which included one from a sword that went all the way through his trunk.\nWolverine\u2019s natural healing also affords him virtual immunity to poisons and most drugs, as well as an enhanced resistance to diseases. For example, it is nearly impossible for him to become intoxicated from drinking alcohol. He also has a limited immunity to the fatigue poisons generated by bodily activity, and hence he has greater endurance than an ordinary human. His agility and reflexes are similarly enhanced.\nIn addition, Wolverine\u2019s healing factor provides him with an extended lifespan by slowing the effects of the aging process. Although over a century old, Wolverine is as healthy and physically fit as a man in his prime.\nWolverine also possesses superhumanly acute senses, making him capable of seeing things at a maximum distance greater than a normal human\u2019s. His hearing is enhanced in a similar manner, and he is able to recognize people and objects by scent, even if that person or object is hidden. Wolverine can use these enhanced senses to track any creature with an impressive degree of success.\nWolverine\u2019s skeleton includes six retractable one-foot long bone claws, three in each arm, that are housed beneath the skin and muscle of his forearms. Wolverine can, at will, release these slightly curved claws through his skin beneath the knuckles on each hand. The skin between the knuckles tears and bleeds, but the blood loss is quickly halted by his healing factor. Wolverine can unsheathe any number of his claws at once, although he must keep his wrists straight at the moment his claws shoot from his forearms into his hands. When unsheathed, the claws are fully within his hands, and thus Wolverine can still bend his wrists. The claws are naturally sharp and tougher than that of normal human bone structure, allowing Wolverine to cut through most types of flesh and natural materials.\n\nDespite the extent of his healing factor, Wolverine is not immortal. If the injuries are extensive enough, especially if they result in the loss of vital organs, large amounts of blood, and/or loss of physical form, such as having flesh burned away by fire or acid, Wolverine can die.",

        "abilities": "Captain America had mastered the martial arts of American-style boxing and judo, and had combined these disciplines with his own unique hand-to-hand style of combat. He had also shown skill and knowledge of a number of other martial arts. He engaged in a daily regimen of rigorous exercise (including aerobics, weight lifting, gymnastics, and simulated combat) to keep himself in peak condition. Captain America was one of the finest human combatants Earth had ever known.",
        "weapons": "Captain America's only weapon was his shield, a concave disk 2.5 feet in diameter, weighing 12 pounds. It is made of a unique Vibranium-metal alloy that has never been duplicated. The shield was cast by American metallurgist Dr. Myron MacLain, who was contracted by the U.S. government to create an impenetrable substance to use for tanks during World War II. MacLain was never able to duplicate the process due to his inability to identify a still unknown factor that played a role in it. The shield was awarded to Captain America by the government several months after the beginning of his career.\nThe shield has great aerodynamic properties: it is able to slice through the air with minimal wind resistance and deflection of path. Its great overall resilience, combined with its natural concentric stiffness, enables it to rebound from objects with minimal loss of angular momentum. It is virtually indestructible: it is resistant to penetration, temperature extremes, and the entire electromagnetic spectrum of radiation. The only way it can be damaged in any way is by tampering with its molecular bonding.",

        "powers": "Adam Warlock possesses a number of superhuman properties and powers derived from his artificially determined genetic structure. His bone and muscle tissue is denser than human, endowing him with superhuman strength and resilience. Among his body's special adaptations are an enclave of cells able to tap and transform cosmic energy for personal use. Warlock could use this energy to enhance his physical strength, endurance, and powers of recuperation. He could also employ cosmic energy to negate the force of gravity beneath him, enabling him to fly. In an Earth-like atmosphere, Warlock was able to attain the speed of sound (770 miles per hour). He could use his cosmic energy to locate and enter natural space-warps (discontinuities in the fabric of space) in order to traverse interstellar space. He can also project cosmic energy from his hands as concussive force.\nWarlock's energy-manipulating powers waned at the time he was given the soul-gem by the High Evolutionary. No longer could he direct concussive force from his hands or enhance his strength. Whether this power limitation was caused by his symbiotic relationship with the soul-gem or some other factor is not yet known. When Warlock was summoned from the soul-gem to defeat Thanos, he seemed to possess these cosmic powers once more.\n\nHe is is able to spin a cocoon around him at will in a matter of seconds. He did so infrequently during his short life, usually to protect himself from mortal harm, and usually he would emerge from the cocoon at a further level of physical or mental maturity. It is not known where the substance of the cocoon came from, or where it went after he emerged from it.",

He is vulnerable to magical attack as well as to assaults involving silver, due to its inherent mystical \"purity.\" When last seen he had little control over his werewolf form, which was becoming more bestial and savage, and he likely has even less control under a full moon.\nRussell formerly had total control of his transformation and could trigger or reverse it at will. He could transform his entire body or an isolated portion and could judge people's mental states. Sunlight caused him minor irritation, and he felt an increased urge to transform during the full moon. It was unclear if he could control whether wounds he inflicted turned others into werewolves.",

An unexpected mutation has caused a gland to have grown inside Scorpion\u2019s left arm - her \"Stinger\" -  that naturally generates a powerful toxin that can stun or even kill an adult human when released through her fingertips. She can control the concentration of toxins, killing her target outright or simply making them ill. However, she can never turn off the ability. Carmilla's stinger takes effort to control, and even when she is subduing its affects to the best of her ability, being in close proximity to the arm for more than a week or two can sicken most people. Numerous side effects from this ability abound; for example, Carmilla\u2019s body will spontaneously grow nictating membranes over her eyes to allow her to see normally in the middle of a tear gas attack. \nS.H.I.E.L.D. scientists have theorized that the toxin produced by Carmilla\u2019s arm works not unlike the poisonous metal thallium; when exposed to intense radiation, thallium breaks down into a microscopic powder that is almost impossible to purge from human tissue. To add credence to this theory, when Scorpion increases the dosage of her \u201cstinging touch\u201d to instantly incapacitate a victim, the area around her arm glows green \u2013 and, in fact, a toxic green cloud envelopes the area of the victim that she hit.",

He also possesses superhuman agility, reflexes, and speed, with a maximum swimming speed of roughly sixty miles per hour. Namor is able to fly via the finlike wings on his ankles, and he possesses a telepathic rapport with many, but not all, forms of marine life. Like all Atlanteans, he has a prolonged lifespan and his body is specially developed for underwater conditions, granting him specialized blood circulation to withstand freezing temperatures and highly developed vision to see clearly even in murky ocean depths. This hybrid physiology means he can survive indefinitely underwater or on land (though he would still need occasional contact with water to survive). Namor possesses an empathic bond with his cousin Namorita.\nIn the past, Namor has demonstrated additional powers similar to the attributes of various forms of sea life, including the electricity-generating capabilities of an electric eel and the radar sense of cavefish; however, he has demonstrated such abilities only sporadically, suggesting that they depend upon some factor of his Atlantean mutant nature that is not yet understood.\n\nWhen not exposed to water, Namor\u2019s physical attributes gradually decline and can diminish over time to near-human levels, robbing him of his strength and rendering him vulnerable to conventional injuries; renewed exposure to water will immediately restore his abilities. Complete lack of contact with water will prove fatal in about a week\u2019s time. Namor has demonstrated a vulnerability to oxygen imbalance when remaining too long in either water or air, resulting in manic-depressive mood swings; he can prevent this imbalance by dividing his time between the two atmospheres. He has occasionally used scientific or magical means to regulate his oxygen levels.",

He can also hover or fly silently by means of anti-gravity generators, maintain internal temperature to radiate great amounts of heat or cold through his hands, and can channel electrical energy through his circuits and release it at a touch. He has a pair of modified .357 Magnum pistols installed in his index fingers, which has since been revealed as only part of an arsenal that includes a gas chromatograph, a laser interferometer, micro-pulse radar, an audiometer, a seismometer, a gravity wave detector, a pulse-code modulator, standard computer input/outputs, a radio beacon, an all-wave radio transceiver, and a laser cutting torch/ weapon. X-51 is highly dependent on solar receptors for energy, and if not exposed to light, he will shut down.",

        "powers": "In compensation for his lost sight, Daredevil\u2019s other four senses have been preternaturally enhanced.\nHis sense of touch is sensitive enough to detect the faint impressions of ink on paper, allowing him to read by touch.  He is also able to feel minute changes in temperature and pressure, enough to sense a human body at a distance of five feet, due to body heat and air disturbance.  His sensitivity to heat allows him to sense the temperature of people and objects in order to determine whether a person is alive, how long they have been dead if they are not, and other changes in body temperature such as blushing or the heating up associated with various emotional states, as well as residual body heat on an object, or how recently a machine has been in use.\nDaredevil\u2019s sense of smell is enhanced enough to distinguish individuals by their natural odors, and remember and identify them no matter how they attempt to mask their scent, as well as track that individual scent through a crowd of people at a distance of roughly 50 feet.\nHis sense of taste is sharp enough to enable him to detect the number of grains of salt on a pretzel.  His ability to remember tastes enables him to determine every ingredient of a food or drink he tastes, as long as there are at least 20 milligrams of that substance present.\nDaredevil\u2019s enhanced sense of hearing enables him to detect an acoustic pressure change of 1 decibel at a pressure level of 7, whereas the average human can only detect a sound as low as 20 decibels.  He can even hear people speaking through a standard soundproofed wall.  Daredevil is also able to hear a heartbeat from 20 feet away, as well as identify people by their individual beat rhythm, or detect whether they are lying or not by the changes in their heartbeat, though a pace maker or self control will confuse his reading.  Not only does Daredevil\u2019s hearing allow him to be constantly aware of his own heartbeat, blood circulation, breathing, physical movements, etc, but he is also able to hear and sense the same attributes in other people.  One of the primary ways he does this is by hearing the reverberations made by ambient sounds on objects and people, giving him a sonar-like sense of where things are, and how dense they are.  And while he is able to block out a good amount of background noise, he can also be excessively disoriented by unexpected loud noises and can be confused when immersed in the wash of sound from a busy crowd.\nAlong with the enhancement of Daredevil\u2019s normal senses, he has gained another sense which he calls his Radar Sense.  According to one theory, this sense reacts to an emission of electromagnetic energy a mutation in his brain has caused, reading the reverberations of this energy as a 360\u00ba, 3-D map of objects.  This \u201csight\u201d is not perfect, and can only give Daredevil an impression of the exact physical shape of objects, not a literal one.  Closely overlapping objects can also confuse this sense.\n\nThe mutations that have heightened Daredevil\u2019s level of sensitivity have also increased his awareness of other forms of electromagnetic radiation.  He is capable of detecting and identifying any electromagnetic radiation on the standard scale; from radio waves, (which he can only detect, not understand the message) all the way to gamma waves, and everything in between.  He is also able to judge the strength of a given radiation and even differentiate between individual colors by the amount of radiation they give off.  At very close range, Daredevil is able to detect the micro voltage of a human being\u2019s brain.",

Josiah can lift (press) up to a maximum of 850 pounds with extreme effort.

Unlike the Hulk, whose physical strength is potentially limitless due to the fact that the Hulk's strength increases with his level of anger, the Red Hulk becomes hotter as he grows angrier leaving huge amounts of residual radiation after a heated confrontation. This temperature increase may serve as a hindrance to the Red Hulk but that has yet to be determined. \n\nThe Red Hulk can also use his superhumanly strong leg muscles to leap great distances including into orbit around the Earth. The Red Hulk has shown to be nearly invulnerable to physical damage regardless of the cause, and has also shown the ability to regenerate damaged areas of tissue at an amazing rate. It is entirely possible that the Red Hulk also has the Hulk's resistance to extreme temperatures, poisons, and diseases but that, too, has yet to be revealed. However, as in outer space, Red Hulk can hold his breath for an extremely long amount of time and function normally, even under times of great duress.\n\nAn attribute of the Red Hulk which isn't known to many is what gives him his tremendous power. Red Hulk is able to absorb radiation at will, mostly gamma radiation, but he can also absorb other types such as cosmic radiation. The more he absorbs, the more powerful he becomes. However, Red Hulk is susceptible to mind control.  \n\n\nAt one time, Ross's mind controlled the form of Zzzax and commanded Zzzax's powers too. When his mind was returned to his original body, Ross could still release some of the electromagnetic energy at will for a brief period.",

The duplicates think, feel, and act independently, though usually guided by the original. Each tends to manifest one aspect of Madrox's personality, which increases in strength with lengthier separation from the original; these traits have recently become more extreme. Madrox is telepathically and empathically linked to his duplicates, suffering severe, potentially fatal, trauma if one dies. Madrox can \"reabsorb\" his duplicates, gaining their new knowledge and skills. Similarly, he will acquire any physical injury - though not any actual toxin - from a duplicate; symptoms are typically lessened by half during absorption. If Madrox himself were killed, it is not known whether any existing duplicates would continue to function independently; it is virtually impossible to distinguish the original from the duplicates.",

It gave him god-like strength, speed, durability, endurance and agility. Air-Walker could fire blasts of heat, concussive force, magnetism, anti-gravity, and electricity. Using his power at peak capacity, Air-Walker could function for months before succumbing to fatigue. He was immune to extreme temperature changes, most radiation and can survive in the vacuum of space indefinitely without food, water, or air as well as navigate hyperspace unaided. The Power Cosmic also granted him the ability to analyze and rearrange matter and energy. When entering planetary atmospheres, he would curtail his speed as to not cause devastating side effects. \nHe could manipulate the forces of nature, altering weather patterns, generate such states as rain or fog, produce winds of varying degrees and intensities up to hurricane force, raise or lower humidity and temperature, induce lightning or other electrical atmospheric phenomena, and dispense natural storms. Air-Walker could direct the path of certain atmospheric effects, such as bolts of lightning and could manipulate ocean currents by creating hurricanes and tidal waves. He also had \"Cosmic Awareness\" in the sense that he could detect various energy signatures throughout space.\n\nGabriel's android form could replicate all his original powers at approximately the same levels by channeling the cosmic energy through its fiery cloak, which acted as a receptor, into its cosmic cells. If drained, the cells could be recharged by an outside source. The automatic self-repair circuitry within its chest cavity would function as long as 35% of the total system was intact. Combined with the Power Cosmic, his android body could withstand large amounts of physical damage and possessed a homing beacon in tune with Galactus' worldship, Taa II.",

Unlike the Hulk, whose physical strength is potentially limitless due to the fact that the Hulk's strength increases with his level of anger, the Red Hulk becomes hotter as he grows angrier leaving huge amounts of residual radiation after a heated confrontation. This temperature increase may serve as a hindrance to the Red Hulk but that has yet to be determined. \n\nThe Red Hulk can also use his superhumanly strong leg muscles to leap great distances including into orbit around the Earth. The Red Hulk has shown to be nearly invulnerable to physical damage regardless of the cause, and has also shown the ability to regenerate damaged areas of tissue at an amazing rate. It is entirely possible that the Red Hulk also has the Hulk's resistance to extreme temperatures, poisons, and diseases but that, too, has yet to be revealed. However, as in outer space, Red Hulk can hold his breath for an extremely long amount of time and function normally, even under times of great duress.\n\nAn attribute of the Red Hulk which isn't known to many is what gives him his tremendous power. Red Hulk is able to absorb radiation at will, mostly gamma radiation, but he can also absorb other types such as cosmic radiation. The more he absorbs, the more powerful he becomes. However, Red Hulk is susceptible to mind control.  \n\n\nAt one time, Ross's mind controlled the form of Zzzax and commanded Zzzax's powers too. When his mind was returned to his original body, Ross could still release some of the electromagnetic energy at will for a brief period.",

Cypher\u2019s skills were such that he was once able to make great headway in translating the written language of an extraterrestrial race in a matter of minutes.\nCypher\u2019s mutant talent for translating differed from the translating ability that a human who is a genius in this field, yet not a mutant, possesses, even though both people might achieve the same results with any given translation problem. Cypher\u2019s mutant talent was an intuitive one which worked on a subconscious level, and which may in part be related to telepathy. A non-mutant human, even a genius, would have to work out a translation consciously, step by step. Cypher, however, could subconsciously solve the problem. Hence, Cypher could reach the correct solution by means that appeared to be leaps of logic, and he himself may not have been consciously aware of the entire process by which he reached the right answer.",

Unlike the Hulk, whose physical strength is potentially limitless due to the fact that the Hulk's strength increases with his level of anger, the Red Hulk becomes hotter as he grows angrier leaving huge amounts of residual radiation after a heated confrontation. This temperature increase may serve as a hindrance to the Red Hulk but that has yet to be determined. \n\nThe Red Hulk can also use his superhumanly strong leg muscles to leap great distances including into orbit around the Earth. The Red Hulk has shown to be nearly invulnerable to physical damage regardless of the cause, and has also shown the ability to regenerate damaged areas of tissue at an amazing rate. It is entirely possible that the Red Hulk also has the Hulk's resistance to extreme temperatures, poisons, and diseases but that, too, has yet to be revealed. However, as in outer space, Red Hulk can hold his breath for an extremely long amount of time and function normally, even under times of great duress.\n\nAn attribute of the Red Hulk which isn't known to many is what gives him his tremendous power. Red Hulk is able to absorb radiation at will, mostly gamma radiation, but he can also absorb other types such as cosmic radiation. The more he absorbs, the more powerful he becomes. However, Red Hulk is susceptible to mind control.  \n\n\nAt one time, Ross's mind controlled the form of Zzzax and commanded Zzzax's powers too. When his mind was returned to his original body, Ross could still release some of the electromagnetic energy at will for a brief period.",
