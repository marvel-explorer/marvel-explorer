The latter means of power usually functions through the recitations of spells, either ritualized ones found in various mystical texts or by original spells invoking extradimensional assistance. The Ancient One also employed a number of occult power objects in performing certain magical feats.\nTo begin with his personal powers, the Ancient One mastered the art of astral projection, the mental ability to separate the astral self-the sheath of the soul, or life essence-from his physical self, and in this form traverse space unbounded by physical laws but fully retaining human consciousness. The astral form is invisible, intangible, and incapable of being harmed except by the most rigorous of mystical means. The astral form only possesses those magical powers residing in the sorcerer's mind (thought-casting, psycho kinesis, etc.) although it can also project bolts of mystical force that are effective only against other astral beings. In his prime the Ancient One possessed such mastery of astral form for up to 24 hours before his physical form would begin to undergo corporeal deterioration. The physical form was quite vulnerable to attack when the astral form was absent. While the Ancient One's astral form was absent, his physical form remained in a deathlike trance. If the Ancient One's physical form had been killed while he was in his astral form, he would have been stranded in his wraithlike state.\nThe Ancient One could mesmerize people to do his bidding, both in person and at a distance. The Ancient One could cast his thoughts over short or vast distances in a manner virtually identical with telepathy. The entire Earth was within the range of the Ancient One's mind, providing he knew where to contact the specific mind he was seeking. The Ancient One could simultaneously mentally communicate with up to a dozen minds at one time.\nThe Ancient One was also able to tap this universe's store of ambient magical energy mentally and to manipulate it mentally for a variety of effects. The Ancient One was able to form and hurl magical energy bolts with a high degree of potency and control. He was able to erect mystical energy shields or screens with a high degree of imperviousness to both physical and magical damage. He was able to use local magical energy for the conjuration of small physical objects or for unusual luminescent effects. The Ancient One could also transform one object into another, although the transformation only lasted for as long as he willed it.\nThe Ancient One was sometimes able to utilize magical energy to teleport himself across the face of the Earth or into a mystical dimension (certain higher dimensions where the physical laws can be based more on magic than on scientific principles in numerous cases). Oddly enough, teleportation within a dimension is more taxing than teleportation between dimensions. Such expenditure of energy leaves all human sorcerers mystically debilitated for varying lengths of time. Physical teleportation across time rather than space is the most power-draining means of teleportation. Hence, in his later years, the Ancient One refrained from performing self-teleportation.\nThe Ancient One possessed a knowledge of a host of sorcerous spells and incantations invoking the names and aspects of various extradimensional objects and beings of power. The Ancient One was able to call upon these extradimensional sources of mystical power for very specific effects without taxing his own personal abilities. Some of these extradimensional phenomena included the Flames of the Faltine, the Shades of the Seraphim, and the Hoary Hosts of Hoggoth.\nIn his extreme old age, the Ancient One was unable to perform major feats of sorcery without placing great physical strain upon himself.\n\nUpon his physical death, the Ancient One's spirit achieved mystical union with the universe.

It is theoretically possible for Aurora to reach 99% of the speed of light (186,272 miles per second in a vacuum), but practical reasons - such as her inability to breathe at such speeds and the damage her body would suffer from wind and friction - prevent her from reaching anywhere near that speed. Even a fraction of such velocity of a solid object through Earth\u2019s atmosphere would wreak havoc on the atmosphere and on the land or sea below. As a side effect of partially robbing her molecules of their atomic motion, the binding forces within and between the molecules increase which enhances the sheer toughness of Aurora\u2019s entire body. This effect gives her skin enough durability to withstand speeds up to at least Mach 10 without injury. Formerly, by coming into physical contact with her brother, Aurora could vary the rate of acceleration of her molecules to release a cascade of photons as bright as a lighthouse beacon.\nFollowing alteration of her cellular structure by Sasquatch, Aurora\u2019s powers evolved from being able to generate light by herself to the point where she could transform into a being of pure light, the energy from which could bring inner peace to others. When these powers were exhausted, Aurora was still able to generate light and could alter its intensity from a hypnotic glow to dazzling brilliance or even concussive force.\n\nAfter genetic modification by the Weapon X Project, Aurora can now accelerate the molecules within an inanimate object or a living being by touch, causing it to tear itself apart from the subsequent stress generated upon it.'], u'First Appearance': [u'(As Beaubier) X-Men #120 (1979), (as Aurora) X-Men #121 (1979)'], u'Known Relatives': [u'Jean-Baptiste Beaubier (father, deceased), unidentified mother (deceased), Jean-Paul Beaubier (Northstar, twin brother) Joanna Beaubier (adopted niece, deceased); Lois and Genevieve Martin (first cousins once removed/adopted parents, deceased)'], u'Eyes': [u'Blue'], u'Citizenship': [u'Canada'], u'Weight': [u'140 lbs.'], u'Occupation': [u'Terrorist; former adventurer, nun, history/geography teacher'], u'Height': [u'5\'11"'], u'Hair': [u'Black'], u'Place of Birth': [u'Montreal, Quebec, Canada'], 'marvel_id': [1009163], u'Physical Attributes': [u'Height5\'11"\n\nWeight140 lbs.\n\nEyesBlue\n\nHairBlack'], 'marvel_name': [u'Aurora'], u'Education': [u"Madame DuPont's School for Girls"], u'Real Name': [u'Jeanne-Marie Beaubier'], 'thumbnail': [u'http://i.annihil.us/u/prod/marvel/i/mg/f/10/4c004203f1072.jpg'], u'Identity': [u'Secret'], u'Aliases': [u'Once mistaken for Danielle Belmonde']}, {'description': [u''], u'Universe': [u''], 'total_comics': [30], u'Group Affiliation': [u'Formerly Brotherhood of Mutants, X-Corps, Freedom Force, Project: Wideawake'], u'Powers': [u"Avalanche is a mutant with the superhuman ability to generate powerful waves of vibrations from his hands, creating highly destructive effects.

His telepathy has proven great enough in power and scope as to allow him to read thoughts across vast distances, and even interface with multiple minds, simultaneously.  While the full limits of his mental abilities in this area have yet to be disclosed, Cable has also demonstrated the ability to project bolts or blasts of mental energy that are capable of easily killing or rendering unconscious another Human being.  These bolts do not do physical damage.  Cable has also demonstrated mastery of astral projection, and is able to remain on his own plane of existence, or to traverse into any of the so-called "Astral Planes", very much like Professor X.  \nTelekinetically, Cable is capable of very fine control over objects; he can disassemble complex devices explosively (separating every last component, such as screws, nuts, circuit boards, etc.), and just as quickly and easily assemble complex devices.  This also has enabled him to even attain awareness and control over objects as small as individual electrons in an atom.  For instance, Cable could detect if a seal was hermetic, or not, by checking for the presence of penetrating oxygen molecules.  He could even detect and discern individual oxygen molecules, and determine the atomic weight of molecules, by the amount of atoms present. Cable has also demonstrated the ability to alter molecular and atomic structures in such substances as his own techno-organic components (though this may be a function of telekinesis, as opposed to a discreet superhuman power).   \nOn larger levels, Cable can levitate great weights, into the tons, but his upper limit has remained undisclosed.  This is possible that he doesn\u2019t know his own limits, but it is unlikely, due to his intense commitment to training; more likely, Cable chooses not to disclose the full extent of his abilities, as he knows this is data that could be utilized against him, by opponents or even former allies.  Cable has also been seen creating protective force fields around himself and others through the use of his telekinetic powers.  The upper limits of this ability remain unknown, but it is believed that he could probably protect himself from harm at the ground zero detonation of a 1 kiloton nuclear warhead (4.18 terajoules of energy from the heat, concussion and radiation effects).  It is possible that this may not be his upper limit, and may also be an indicator of the limits of his ability to lift large weights telekinetically.  Cable has also displayed such control over the fields as to shape them precisely, even to conform very closely to his body\u2019s form.  There does not appear to be any correlation between field strength and the thickness of the telekinetic fields.  Originally, Cable was telekinetically preoccupied by using his power to inhibit the progression of his body\u2019s techno-organic virus throughout his body, and this was a process that required constant attention.  With the solution to this problem through his merger with a techno-organic embryo, however, this function is no longer necessary, leaving him totally free to concentrate his telekinetic powers on other things.  \nHe has displayed the ability to control the minds and even voluntary and involuntary bodily functions of sentient beings (such as other Humans) \nCable has proven very difficulty to psychically assail, as he is very well skilled in shielding his own mind from mental-attacks (such as attempts to read, control or harm his own mind), and has been sufficient to protect himself from other psychics on the level of Phoenix (Jean Grey), Professor X and Marvel Girl (Rachel Grey).\nMuch of Cable\u2019s body has been infiltrated and altered by the techno-organic virus, which has taken the form of cybernetics and bionics, meaning he is a cyborg.  The primary infection resides in Cable\u2019s left side.  As a consequence of his telekinetic guidance and his ability to control his own physical substance, Cable\u2019s entire body has been heavily fortified, down to the cellular level, rendering superhuman strength to an unknown degree, as well as a superhuman level of resistance to physical harm.  While he was injured in combat with the Hulk, the injuries were not nearly as severe as they should\u2019ve been, especially in light of the fact that he was suffering from the effects of his techno-organic virus getting out of control.  His entire skeletal structure has been replaced by porous, marrow-filled organic metalloid bone replacements that do not interfere with the creation of erythrocytes (red blood cells).  \nCable possesses superhuman physical endurance, just as he does superhuman levels of mental endurance.  He is capable of exerting himself at peak levels (fighting full-out, sprinting, etc.) for several hours, before fatigue begins to visibly impair his performance.  He is also capable of going extended periods of time without sleep, being fully capable of fully resting with not much over an hour of sleep.  However, whenever both possible and feasible, Cable still chooses to sleep for hours at a time (approximately 6 \u2013 8), in order to dream.  This high endurance has had other effects on his body, making even his soft tissues extremely durable, and more than up to the task of rendering him virtually immune to conventional firearms and conventional firearm munitions.  \nHis entire CNS (Central Nervous System) has been augmented by chemical changes down to the atomic level and by biocomputer enhancement, rendering his reaction time far above what is possible for a Human being.  In spite of his great size and impressive build, Cable is literally fast enough to evade high-powered bullets in-flight (after they have been fired), and even has the ability to visually track rounds after they\u2019ve been fired (though they are not easy to see, except through his cybernetic eye).  This great speed is also visible in superhuman levels of dexterity and agility, including manual and pedal dexterity.  Spotting the speedster Super-Saber running at superhuman speed, Cable was actually able to physically attack and stop him.  Super-Saber, himself, was fast enough to create \u201csonic booms\u201d by snapping his fingers, and also had superhumanly high reaction time.  However, in spite of his obviously great speed, he is still not as fast as other paranormals like Spider-Man and Daredevil.\nAmong his many cybernetic functions, Cable possesses a cybernetic left eye.  This eye permits Cable to see deep into the EM (Electro-Magnetic) spectrum, and far deeper than any known 20th \u2013 21st century technologies are capable of.  It is also possible that through this eye, Cable is able to see the deployment of psionic energies, as well as the less exotic spectra of electromagnetic energies.\nHis left arm is completely mechanical, and while Cable is ambidextrous, is his stronger arm, probably capable of allowing him to curl and deadlift several tons, without assistance from his right arm.  His right arm is also cybernetic, but far less so.\nThrough a combination of his telekinetic abilities, and his ability to rearrange the atomic structures of matter (including his own techno-organic matter), Cable is able to rapidly repair any damaged components within his body.  However, if there is widespread damage, this may not be possible, as he may be unable to muster the energy to affect these repairs.  When he was attacked by Magneto, and virtually every component in the left side of his body was damaged or destroyed, Cable was left unable to repair enough systems to save his own life, and required outside assistance.  It is through these abilities that the physical appearance of his cybernetic components has changed, over the passage of time, as well.  At times, they have been articulated, smooth artificial limbs, while at others they have been observed to grow razor-sharp blades on command, as well as retract them.  Cable is also able to rapidly redesign and improve his cybernetic and bionic components, thus.  On-the-spot improvisations has allowed him to create a variety of microcomputers in his totally mechanized left arm that do such things as allow him to physically interface with exterior computers, uplink/download to computers he has hidden across the world and in space (such as those he had on Graymalkin), and even permit cellular communications and high-speed, broadband, wireless Internet access.\n\nCable possesses an intellect that may be on par with that of Reed Richards, which may be superhuman.  He is also in possession of an education provided by the Clan Askani, which is far in advance of 20th \u2013 21st century Earth-616 conventional education, especially in the sciences.'], u'First Appearance': [u'(As Nathan Summers) Uncanny X-Men #201 (1986); (as Cable) New Mutants #87 (1990)'], u'Known Relatives': [u'Philip Summers (great-grandfather), Deborah Summers (great-grandmother), Christopher Summers (Corsair, grandfather, deceased), Katherine Anne Summers (grandmother, deceased), Scott Summers (Cyclops/Slym Dayspring, father), Madelyne Pryor-Summers (mother, deceased), Jean Grey-Summers (Phoenix/Redd Dayspring, stepmother), Alexander Summers (Havok, uncle), Gabriel Summers (Vulcan, uncle), Adam-X (X-Treme, alleged uncle), John Grey (step-great-grandfather, deceased), Elaine Grey (step-great-grandmother, deceased), Sara Bailey (step-aunt, deceased), Gailyn Bailey (step-cousin), Joey Bailey (step-cousin), Aliya Jenskot (wife, deceased), Hope (sister-in-law), Tyler Dayspring (Genesis, son, deceased), Stryfe (clone, deceased), Rachel Grey (Marvel Girl, alternate universe half-sister), Nathan Grey (X-Man, alternate universe half-brother), numerous alternate Earth relations'], u'Eyes': [u'Blue'], u'Abilities': [u'Cable is a highly accomplished warrior and battle strategist, highly adept in many forms of hand-to-hand combat and in the use of a variety of weaponry from both the 20th and 40th Centuries.

Each tentacle, approximately five inches in diameter, terminates in three single-jointed pincers. The pincers are able to rotate in relation to the arm for 360 degrees, in a screwdriver-like twisting motion. Each tentacle segment contains four high-efficiency electric motors equipped with a clutched, helical-gear train, independently mounted on frictionless gimbals and housed in four thin, overlapping layers of titanium-niobium steel. The titanium-steel alloy is light, has high-tensile strength, a high melting point, and high thin-wall rigidity. The motors get their power from a small nuclear-powered thermo-electric generator, which can provide several hundred watts per hour for up to five years before needing to replace its U-239 core. The tentacles have been modified since the time of the original accident to include high-efficiency battery packs (enabling movement when cut off from the central power source) and individual micro-circuit control modules (enabling each arm to perform certain pre-programmed actions when Octopus loses conscious control). In the event that Octopus loses consciousness, the control module of each arm has enough pre-programmed conditional responses in its memory chip to enable it to perform a relatively complex sequence of actions, such as saving his life. The trauma of his arm or arms being separated from the harness causes a period of disorientation in which his arms flail about uncontrollably until the pre-programming takes over. \nTelescoping: Each tentacle is approximately six feet long at full contraction, but can extend to a maximum of 24 feet in length.  \nSuperhuman Striking Force: Each tentacle is capable of moving at a speed of ninety feet per second and strike with the force of a jackhammer. \nHigh-Wind Generation: The tentacles can generate 50 mile per hour winds if spun like a giant fan. \nWall-Climbing and Traveling: By combining the intrinsic strength of both his tentacles and the pincers, Doctor Octopus can scale stone, brick, or concrete walls by rending "handholds" in the surface of the wall. Octopus is able to use his tentacles for traversing horizontal distances as well. At full extension, he can travel high above the ground as if on stilts, either using two tentacles, or for maximum speed (approximately 50 miles per hour), four tentacles. \nSensation Feeling: Although there are no nerve endings throughout the length of his artificial arms, Octopus can "feel" basic sensations with them. As a result of the mutagenic changes from exposure to radiation during the accident, electrical connections have been made from his chest harness to his spine. Thus, Doctor Octopus can mentally perceive "tactile" sensations by feeling the amount of electrical resistance that the pincer\'s electric motors feel when the pincers grasp an object.'], 'total_comics': [70], u'Group Affiliation': [u'Formerly Thunderbolts Army, Sinister Six, Masters of Evil'], u'Powers': [u'After the explosion that grafted the tentacled harness to Dr. Octavius, he was misdiagnosed with brain damage.

When Franklin achieves the conscious use of his full powers, he will have telepathic powers, tremendous telekinetic powers, the ability to fire enormously powerful energy blasts, and the ability to rearrange the molecular structure of matter, even up to a cosmic scale.\nFranklin Richards has imposed mental blocks within his own mind to prevent him from using most of his psionic potential while he is still such a young child. It is possible that the strength of these blocks has faded over time, or that they cannot prevent him from utilizing his full powers unconsciously, as he did in creating the alternate reality to which he dispatched his parents and others following their clash with Onslaught. The mental blocks also work only when Franklin is in his physical body; his astral form can apparently use all of his psionic potential if it has separated from his physical form.\nThe mental blocks did not restrict Franklin from using his precognitive abilities, which manifest themselves in his dreams, enabling him to envision possible future events. Although there are countless possible futures, Franklin foresees the most probable future path, and therefore his predictions usually come true. Franklin seemingly cannot foresee events more than roughly a few days in the future. Franklin\'s precognitive power developed to the point at which he could see images of future events even when he\'s conscious.\nFranklin also developed the ability to place himself in a trance-like state while remaining fully conscious. While he is in this trance, he can project an intangible, ghostlike image of himself to another location, through which he can see and hear what goes on at that location. What Franklin has called the "dreams" he has while in this state are not truly dreams, but his conscious awareness of the environment into which he has projected his "dream-self." It is not yet known how far Franklin can project his "dream-self" away from his physical body, but he has projected it onto a planet while his physical body was in a starship high above the planet\'s surface.\n\nFranklin has not recently manifested his powers to perceive the future or to project a "dream-self" and it is not clear whether he can still use these abilities or whether they have returned to latency.'], u'First Appearance': [u'Fantastic Four Annual #6'], u'Known Relatives': [u'Reed Richards (Mister Fantastic, father), Susan Storm Richards (Invisible Woman, mother), Valeria Richards (sister), Jonathan Storm (Human Torch, uncle), Nathaniel Richards (paternal grandfather), Franklin Storm (maternal grandfather, deceased), Evelyn Richards, Mary Storm (grandmothers (paternal and maternal respectively), deceased), Benjamin J.

Even his heralds, imbued with the smallest fraction of his power, can manipulate matter and energy far beyond human comprehension. Though he generally avoids physical conflict, Galactus can bolster his own strength beyond any known system of measure. Galactus is telepathic, able to scan the thoughts of virtually any known being. \nTo sustain his immense power, Galactus requires energies derived from a biosphere, a planet able to sustain living beings, though life does not actually have to be present. Though Galactus can extract and absorb this energy himself, he generally employs his immense Elemental Converter to perform the process, as it is far more efficient and avoids the expenditure required of him. Sometimes the planets on which he feeds are left barely habitable; other times he consumes all life and water, leaving it devastated and barren; most often the process reduces the planet to space rubble. When Galactus was newly formed, the energy of a medium-size Earth-like planet sustained him for over a century. Now he needs to feed about once a month; in addition, when preparing for a massive expenditure of energy, he may absorb planets more frequently to amplify his power stores. Conversely, when he does not feed within his allotted time, his energies will dwindle, and he will even begin to physically shrink as they drop dangerously low.

Should Havok direct his energy at the lowest level, he can project it towards a human being and his target will suffer a severe headache but will not burn up.\n\nHavok's body is constantly in the process of absorbing cosmic radiation. When each of his body's power-storage cell enclaves reaches its capacity, excess cosmic energy is thereafter absorbed and immediately re-emitted in negligible quantities. Upon the total expenditure of all his available energy, it takes Havok's body about 16 hours to recharge to its peak level.

Sue can also mentally generate a psionic field of invisible force apparently drawn from hyperspace, which she manipulates for a variety of effects. Most commonly, Sue generates near-indestructible invisible force fields around herself or other targets. She can vary the texture and tensile strength of her field to some extent, rendering it highly rigid or as soft and yielding as foam; softer variations on the field enable her to cushion impacts more gently, and are less likely to result in a psionic backlash against Sue herself (in rare cases, sufficiently powerful attacks on her psionic fields can cause her mental or physical pain). \nSue can shape her psionic force fields into invisible constructs, usually simple shapes such as barriers, columns, cones, cylinders, darts, discs, domes, platforms, rams, ramps, slides and spheres. By generating additional force behind her psionic constructs, Sue can turn them into offensive weapons, ranging from massive invisible battering rams to small projectiles such as spheres and darts. She can generate solid force constructs as small as a marble or as large as 100 feet in diameter, and her hollow projections such as domes can extend up to several miles in area. By forming one of her force fields within an object and expanding the field, Sue can cause her target to explode. She can also travel atop animated constructs such as ramps, stairs, slides, columns and stepping discs, enabling her to simulate a limited approximation of levitation or flight.

Sabretooth's primary mutant power is an accelerated healing factor that enables him to regenerate damaged or destroyed tissue with far greater speed and efficiency than an ordinary human.  Sabretooth can fully heal from injuries that result in massive tissue and blood loss such as multiple gunshots, slashes, puncture wounds, and severe burns within only a few minutes. This mutant healing factor also renders Sabretooth highly resistant, possibly even totally immune, to disease.  Sabretooth's healing powers, also, render him immune to most drugs and toxins, except within massive doses. sabretooth can lift [press] 118 tons. Sabretooth ages much slower than an ordinary human. Despite having a much greater chronological age, Sabretooth possesses the appearance and vitality of a man in the physical prime of his life.

His night vision is preternaturally sensitive, containing twice the average human being\u2019s area of light-gathering retina, and extends into the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. His hearing is extraordinarily acute, able to detect light breathing in a cave at 200 feet. His sense of taste can detect 1 part of foreign matter in 10,000. His highly developed olfactory sense and memory allow him to detect and track a scent over eight hours old, possibly a concentration of 20 parts per million, that he had not been exposed to for up to several months previously. Dilute, common odors of perspiration, perfumes, cigarettes, candies, and food are beacons to his senses.\nMany of Sabretooth's physical abilities function with superhuman levels of efficiency.  He possesses some degree of superhuman strength, the limits of which are unknown. Originally, Sabretooth possessed sufficient physical strength to crush an iron barbell, with ease. Sabretooth has undergone various procedures, some willingly and some unwillingly, that have increased his strength considerably beyond his original levels. Sabretooth's mutant healing factor grants him much greater immunity to the lactic acids generated by his muscles during physical activity than the musculature of an ordinary human. Hence, Sabretooth possesses superhuman stamina in all physical activities.  His natural agility and reflexes are enhanced to levels that are beyond the natural limits of the human body.

His radically mutagenically altered body composition and increased density enable him to compact or loosen the particles of sand that make up his form. Consequently, the Sandman can become as hard as sandstone, or disperse his body so that he becomes invulnerable to physical attacks. He can shape his sand-state body into any continuous shape he can imagine. He can project his sand particles outward at high speeds and, when in the shape of a bulky object, with the impact of a large sandbag.\nThe Sandman is vulnerable to temperatures over 3,400 degrees Fahrenheit. Such temperatures can cause his highly impure silicate composition to fuse into amorphous silicate (glass). The Sandman maintains mental control of the particles of which his body is composed so that he can reform his scattered grains unless a substantial portion of his body mass has been isolated. Apparently, he can also convert common grains of sand around him into constituents of his body to replenish portions he might lose track of during battle. In this manner, he can increase his overall size and volume (to some as yet unknown limit), or that of his limbs.\nThere appears to be no limit to how long the Sandman can remain in his sand-state.

She can stimulate the creation of any form of precipitation such as rain or fog, generate winds in varying degrees of intensity up to and including hurricane force, raise or lower the humidity and temperature in her immediate vicinity, induce lightning and other electrical atmospheric phenomena, and disperse natural storms so as to create clear change. Storm can direct the path of certain atmospheric effects, such as bolts of lightning, with her hands. She has also demonstrated the ability to manipulate ocean currents, though the extent of this ability is still unclear.\nStorm\u2019s control over the atmosphere is such that she can create certain effects over a specific area while shielding smaller areas within that region. For example, she can create a rainstorm around herself but prevent the raindrops from touching her. Storm can also create atmospheric phenomena over very small areas, such as creating a rainstorm small enough to water a single potted plant.\nStorm can only manipulate weather patterns as they exist in nature. For example, she can end a drought in one area by creating torrential rains there, but that would necessitate robbing all available moisture from the surrounding areas. Storm is not able to create atmospheric conditions that do not exist naturally on the planet she is on. For example, Storm is unable to lower temperatures as far as absolute zero or raise them to solar intensities on Earth.\nThe limit to the size of the area over which Storm can manipulate the weather is not yet known. However, she once diverted the jet stream so as to create storms over the entire East Coast of the United States. She can create weather effects within indoor areas or within artificially maintained environments. Storm is limited by the force of her will and the strength of her body. It once took her several hours to stop a savage blizzard sweeping over much of Canada, and she nearly died from exhaustion in the process.\nStorm is able to fly by creating winds strong enough to support her weight, the weight of others, and to propel her forward through the air. Storm can thus travel as fast as any wind can, and has reached speeds up to 300 miles per hour. Her powers over the atmosphere enable her to breathe at any speed, protect her from air friction, and grant her limited immunity to extreme heat and cold.\nStorm is also able to alter her visual perception so as to perceive electrical energy patterns as well as those factors responsible for existing meteorological phenomena in her surrounding environment.\n\nStorm's ability to manipulate the weather in her immediate vicinity is affected by her emotions; hence, if she does not maintain control, a fit of rage might induce a destructive storm.

He can alter his own size, mass, and density to unknown limits at will (he has appeared at 6 feet in stature as well as 50 feet), or alter the size and mass of other objects and organisms. He can convert matter to an unknown form of energy and teleport it through space at hyper-light speeds. He can erect invisible force shields of great impermeability. Further, he can use cosmic energy to enhance his own physical powers, such as speed, strength, and endurance. He can mentally manipulate gravitons to allow himself to levitate. The extent of the Stranger\u2019s extrasensory and psionic powers are unknown.\nThe Stranger possesses several known limitations to his power.

Namor is able to fly via the finlike wings on his ankles, and he possesses a telepathic rapport with many, but not all, forms of marine life. Like all Atlanteans, he has a prolonged lifespan and his body is specially developed for underwater conditions, granting him specialized blood circulation to withstand freezing temperatures and highly developed vision to see clearly even in murky ocean depths. This hybrid physiology means he can survive indefinitely underwater or on land (though he would still need occasional contact with water to survive). Namor possesses an empathic bond with his cousin Namorita.\nIn the past, Namor has demonstrated additional powers similar to the attributes of various forms of sea life, including the electricity-generating capabilities of an electric eel and the radar sense of cavefish; however, he has demonstrated such abilities only sporadically, suggesting that they depend upon some factor of his Atlantean mutant nature that is not yet understood.\n\nWhen not exposed to water, Namor\u2019s physical attributes gradually decline and can diminish over time to near-human levels, robbing him of his strength and rendering him vulnerable to conventional injuries; renewed exposure to water will immediately restore his abilities.

Mjolnir can absorb other energies into itself, which Thor can then release.\nMjolnir obeys Thor\u2019s commands as though it were alive, and if Thor\u2019s will is strong enough, the hammer can pass through nearly any barrier to reach him should he so desire. Using this command over Mjolnir\u2019s flight path, Thor is able to use the hammer to fly, achieving escape velocities. Mjolnir can also transform Thor into his civilian guises. When Thor is a civilian, the hammer most often becomes an old wooden cane. While employing a mortal guise, Thor will transform back into his mortal form should he be separated from Mjolnir for more than 60 seconds. \n\nBy spinning Mjolnir in a circle, Thor can open portals to other dimensions. Formerly, it also allowed him to travel in time, but Immortus removed this power. Enchantments surrounding Mjolnir prevent it from being wielded by anyone except those who have been found worthy. Thus far, this includes Thor, Odin, Tiwaz, Red Norvell, Beta Ray Bill, Captain America and Eric Masterson.

Most Ultrons are powered by a small internal nuclear furnace, and incorporate a "program transmitter" which can beam part or all of Ultron\'s programming into remote locations such as computers or alternate robotic bodies. Ultron can often control other machines remotely even if he has not transplanted his consciousness into them.

Due to his healing factor, the presence of Adamantium in his body does not interfere with his bones\u2019 normal function of generating blood corpuscles. The reinforcement of his skeleton enables Wolverine to withstand high levels of physical pressure, giving his muscles sufficient force to briefly lift/press several hundred pounds.\nThroughout his life, Wolverine has used a variety of bladed weapons, most frequently daggers and, at times, swords.

The speed at which this healing factor works varies in direct proportion with the severity of the damage Wolverine suffers. For example, he can fully recover from an ordinary gunshot wound in a non-vital area of his body within minutes, but it took him almost two months to fully recover from injuries sustained in a duel with Lord Shingen, which included one from a sword that went all the way through his trunk.\nWolverine\u2019s natural healing also affords him virtual immunity to poisons and most drugs, as well as an enhanced resistance to diseases. For example, it is nearly impossible for him to become intoxicated from drinking alcohol. He also has a limited immunity to the fatigue poisons generated by bodily activity, and hence he has greater endurance than an ordinary human. His agility and reflexes are similarly enhanced.\nIn addition, Wolverine\u2019s healing factor provides him with an extended lifespan by slowing the effects of the aging process. Although over a century old, Wolverine is as healthy and physically fit as a man in his prime.\nWolverine also possesses superhumanly acute senses, making him capable of seeing things at a maximum distance greater than a normal human\u2019s. His hearing is enhanced in a similar manner, and he is able to recognize people and objects by scent, even if that person or object is hidden. Wolverine can use these enhanced senses to track any creature with an impressive degree of success.\nWolverine\u2019s skeleton includes six retractable one-foot long bone claws, three in each arm, that are housed beneath the skin and muscle of his forearms. Wolverine can, at will, release these slightly curved claws through his skin beneath the knuckles on each hand. The skin between the knuckles tears and bleeds, but the blood loss is quickly halted by his healing factor. Wolverine can unsheathe any number of his claws at once, although he must keep his wrists straight at the moment his claws shoot from his forearms into his hands. When unsheathed, the claws are fully within his hands, and thus Wolverine can still bend his wrists. The claws are naturally sharp and tougher than that of normal human bone structure, allowing Wolverine to cut through most types of flesh and natural materials.\n\nDespite the extent of his healing factor, Wolverine is not immortal.
